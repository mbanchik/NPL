It is going to be a very big step from Formula 2 to Formula 1 em but I feel more than ready having you never choose when you are going to get into Formula 1 and my moment came now of course I'm going to try to enjoy it as much as possible but also do the best show I can. So trying to enjoy but also em be in the moment.,0,Franco
"Em to receive that call probably the best moment of my life, I was at the F2 Sim with MP preparing the Formula 2 race here in monsa on Monday so it was very very short notice. My first emotions were mostly yeah excitement, I was em very very proud of what we achieved with with all the people that have been supporting me since I was very young since I came to Europe for the first time um and and yeah it's part of the effort that everyone did in my team around me and therefore for that also William said that this a team effort em yeah let's enjoy this moment.",0,Franco
"yeah Alex we spoke and he gave me many advices of course this is a long process but with all these advices and people supporting me it's making this em learning process a lot quicker, of course Alex has a lot of experience and is one of the best drivers in the grid so I am I think a privilege to have him as a teammate to make all of this quicker.",0,Franco
"yeah to be the first Argentinian in 23 years back in a for for one car racing here in monsai it's something very special, one of the biggest races of the calendar with all the Tios with all the people here, the fans are insane and it's one of the best races to to to make your debut.",0,Franco
"yeah right now until the end of the year I want to go race by race, try to focus mainly on myself, of course help the team to achieve their targets their their goals and yeah let's go forward together, it's a sine races to go it's a quite long em and I got many opportunities to try and evolve as driver, to try and and get the most information I can and of course improve step by step. So let's see what we can do at the end, em let's do Mana first and and then let's see",0,Franco
"yeah yeah yeah it's it's not bad for the first race em the car was very strong, um I am I am very happy of course with the performance we had this weekend um a lot of question marks going into the race of course. ",0,Franco
"I never done more than eight laps in a row before in an F1 car and today we're 53 to do with very high track temps the highest of the weekend and um and a lot of unknown things but I think I've done a good job um it was was always going to be a tough race here with the rears and the team helped me to manage the tires very well, they helped me with the tools and and the car was was very strong I think to manage tires um maybe we thought about that to stop but the one stop was was possible for me I managed well the mediums and then onto the hearts they felt consistent and and very good as well so um we we stayed out and and I did the best lap in the last lap so I think very positive things ",0,Franco
of course a lot of information now to take onto the simulator to take to the factory and understand many things better understanding what to work on um but now very very very positive weekend I think I went step by step and and we've been doing a better show each each session ,0,Franco
of course qualifying was a bit frustrating but with that little mistake but em I think we we worked hard and and brought the team back together for today and I did a good job so happy with that ,0,Franco
"yeah um you know many things are going into a weekend a Formula 1, first of all I couldn't do a a normal preparation because the the the call was very late um which for Baku is a track that I don't know but it's also a track where I'm going to be able to do a lot more and it will help a lot so um we need to keep working on that then a lot of things going on into a weekend em things that I was not used to um and I'm starting to understand better and to adapt as well so it's all part of the process and I think the process has been very quick because it came from one one day to another the same week of the race and and how we ended I think it's em it's very positive and of course the team is happy I am happy as well with the progression and we are looking for forward to to the next few rounds.",0,Franco
"em yeah of course I bit frustrated know after um finishing only 300s of Q3 in a truck that I haven never been before, it's a bit frustrating because I I can easily go back in my lab and and find some lap time em and that's why I I'm not not happy, but I think we we did a good weekend so far and in a truck that I know I didn't have the updates that that Alex Alex has in the car and and I still show that I can be you know up there and and we could be fighting for points even in a track that maybe doesn't suit us so so well, em there is many positives.",0,Franco
"of course that I am frustrated with the result because when you you are so so close it's it is disappointing, and in a truck that is very difficult to take you want to do you want to do a good qual and nail every lap and I felt like like I just didn't nail my last lap, and if I would have done it then I would have been in Q3 so that's that's the reality.",0,Franco
"but overall of course things to review on the data things to improve, but I think it was still a DEC and day and uh Singapore is a very difficult track and and to have back when Singapore in my first three races, you would never choose that you know in your first three formula one weekend so it's been tough, em I think I still deliver good results and em I think we still have all to fight for tomorrow.",0,Franco
it's a it's going to be a very long race and it's going to be tough for the heat and and many things but I still I'm still very optimistic that we have a good race. ,0,Franco
yeah yeah I think so I think you know singapore is a very special track the last few years have been safety cars in every race and and and it's a lot of things to play for and we I think you know I trust in the team and and I trust in the car that we have in the race car and I hope I hope that we can have a good race and score points that's that's what we are going to be working tonight for,0,Franco
here with you mate so super excited to be here in the in the interview very nice to meet you for the first time just uh very excited from the weekend still just came home so yeah nice to be talking with you,0,Franco
I mean I I do feel it and trust me it's insane this word that I'm receiving race by race I just won in Imola few days ago as well so it's increasing and increasing and growing and growing the world them good I think it's by far the the biggest you know fans and and it's lots of people that are pushing me forward from I think compared to any other country just so so much the sport that I'm receiving from my home country and is such a privilege and such a pleasure and I'm you know every success that I have just looks like so so many people enjoy it and that so many will get happy about it so it's it is a pleasure it's I think something that drives me forward and and you know keeps pushing me and motivating me to to achieve good results and achieve at least my my biggest stream that is Formula One but yeah it's going well so far doing good steps forward so yeah let's see how it going do here,0,Franco
yeah it is it is different the car it's quite a bit different and I mean I didn't find that I had to change my drawing so much at the beginning but then looking at data and you know understanding a little bit more heavy the car is and how how the force works in the car I had to do some steps and if you see how we started maybe the first few races and how we are doing now one and after after this you know three-day test in Barcelona that when very well for us I just won the racing Imola so it shows that we did I think very good steps forward and that this the testing was was needed to helping me you know kind of do those steps and then fix fix them in my driving and even though of course the test was a was a partial result we could you know put in put in official race weekend or what we learned there and and have a really really really good racing Imola so I'm doing you know I'm still doing a lot of steps forward but I think the most important is to to keep learning how the car the team we we know that there is still a lot more time to find in many many little details so going well so far of course very very long year ahead so I think Lads of opportunities to keep keep improving myself and and also the team so I think there's still nine races left and we we just started the year and as a rookie you know always the first few races are a little bit more tricky so let's see how how we continue the year,0,Franco
yeah thank you George it is a pleasure it is a pleasure and hope to be here back soon again cheers mate,0,Franco
hello Jim yes I am am very well and very happy to you know be back uh after Monaco resting a bit now in in here in Spain uh in the house of my managers for a for a few days and just training a bit relaxing and um recovering you know from from two tough weekends um very nice weekends but also you know were eh super tough and a lot of things going on during a race weekend so just trying to to rest a bit yesterday was yesterday I got a bit older as well so um it's a still get this feeling that I get starting to get a bit too old but you know I I was say ,0,Franco
yeah yeah I I did enjoy um of course I would have enjoyed a bit more U if it would have been after a podium in Monaco um but unfortunately it wasn't so we had to to to you know celebrate for some different reason um but it was still a nice day here yeah you know in Spain was super sunny and and very hot so you know I could relax quite a lot and just meet some friends and family and um you know be surrounded a bit by nice people here in in Spain so super super happy um and yeah just uh relaxing a bit ,0,Franco
um yeah I don't know I mean for me Imola always delivers you know I have had so many good results in Imola I think I I never left disappointed a race in Italy so far so um I know it has been very nice to me since I started racing there even in Formula I finished in the podum as well so it's you know it's been a track where I think I get on quite well I really like it and the kind of Corners I think really suit my my driving style and it just goes very well there normally so um it's very nice also to get my my first win in Formula 2 there um I did get my first win in F3 and then I got my my first win in Formula 2 so it was I think you know it is a very special track and it is where you achieved you know very important things and where I feel that we started to turn over our our season in F2 um so yeah of course happy about this last two races um a bit disappointed with Monaco but it it is part of the game and uh we had very good good race weekends I think we improved what we needed to improve um qualifyings were were good and also the the race space were were really good as well um a part of course of the last race but that was due to to different stuff um and and you know we worked on the things that we had to and and we I think delivered quite well so I'm happy with these two weekends just you know a bit of This bitter suweet um of not finishing uh where we should have in Monaco but okay okay,0,Franco
um yes I think a lot of things happened since we last spoke um you know it's it's very nice when you when you see that you are growing up year after year and um you get I think a big motivation from it you know from first year in F3 I I won some races I was on poll and then second year signed with Williams ER I I went back to MP to my team we had a super good year um even though maybe we didn't finish as as we should have um had was was a really really positive year and and now here in in Formula 2 they a Formula One in the middle so it's been you know a lot of things going on and um a lot of dreams since I was young achieved um that now are becoming goals you know when when when you do it once um you start to it starts to not be a dream anymore maybe starts to be something that you you look forward in the future and something that you target um and it was I mean think I since I was seven or six years old and starting to watch eh you know Motorsport and racing in Formula 1 and racing in Argentina um my my dream was to one day jump in a Formula 1 car and last year after after only a couple of month with Williams I achieved it so it was um you know incredible the support that I receiv received from them to to put me in that car after only one year in F3 um with them so the trust was eh was you know I think a very important thing for me to have from them and I am you know very happy and very grateful to be part of of the team they have been as I said very supportive and it's a pleasure to be with with Williams and of course that they have helped me to to now achieve this uh this year racing in formula 2 and it is also a pleasure to be competing in the championship that is um before Formula 1 and of course in only the fourth weekend to already have a race wi it it is is very special and I am very happy about it but of course I I want more we I think racing drivers are a bit like that you know you you don't get happy um and and stay happy for for long and you quite quick want to want to change and and and start to you know get the result again not only I win once is doesn't mean a lot I want to win many more races so um see a long way to to go this season and I think we have a lot of work to do with team but it's going it's going well luckily ,0,Franco
yeah I'm sure we will I think get you know better results and and more consistency in these tracks um I think a very good news is that the car is is looking very very good at the moment in in the European tracks that that are you know I bit maybe not so similar to Monaco and Imola I would say a bit more kind of jeda and um Melbourne which are you know different are ma a bit more flat and we are looking good there so looking forward totrucks like Barcelona silveron Austria I think trucks that we can work quite well with our car and um let's see how it goes ,0,Franco
I am excited to to come back you know to tracks that we are a bit more used to and starting to race there I also really enjoyed it to be honest racing in in Monaco and and melbour even if it it didn't go super well um there are we I I always enjoy eh in Australia and going there it's it is amazing I I love the country and you know to to get the chance to drive so far away um of Europe once it it is really cool as well and um I did enjoy a lot the season so far of course I have worked quite hard to to improve things that you know I had to um and and luckily you know I could I could fix it quite quick and I think that the test of Barcelona that we've had it was very helpful to to you know just clean those Le little details a little bit that I was not fully fully on it yet um and it has worked you know after the this the performance was much better in in some aspects that we need to improve and and I am happy with that then,0,Franco
um yeah Jim I think you know to have how in the team has been um to me quite helpful um to to improve of course those those things that I was not used to I think with my driving style I was you know driving just quite different to what the car needed like in in F2 and like I could see that quite quite quickly in the season and and fix it quite fast which was I think very important um I had done you know some little mistakes as well in the year beginning first first two rounds and then um was good to fix it quick as well I think was those two or three first races where I I I could do some I could afford to do some you know little mistakes and then eh quite quickly I think I I realized and starting to work quite hard in the things I had to and and focusing well on on the things I had to focus with the team and and they have been helpful to um you know show me a pretty big and clear picture about um what we needed to focus on and and we did and and it is going well and then is of course was um a big part of it eh you know to have his data um it was it was very good and and it is working well of course,0,Franco
um he was was faster the first few rounds and now the last two I have been in front in qualifying so it's it is good news you know for me to um already be a lot closer to him h of course would be better in front always but to see me to see me you know just there and and being close to him it it's a you know a little boost to to that just tells you that you are doing the things correctly and that you are going through the right direction um so yeah I think it is a way to go it's a long year and um luckily I have a lot of people that want me to do well as well and that are you know supporting me a lot and helping me you know do step by step and and push me forward so I think it is um important to have you know the right team around you um and I think I do this year so I'm quite happy still need to do a lot more work um but I you know I'm happy that I saw an improvement quite quickly in the year that's that I think it's is the best news so far even though we still need to to you know get more podiums and a lot more wins the car is capable of doing that so let's see how how we continue the year,0,Franco
no I think it was a a very good race yeah after a tricky start you know I settled into my Pace I knew I had a good race Pace coming from testing and with the work that we've done and just settled into my rhythm and started overtaking cars and yeah kept it up with Checo which wasn't easy today because the Redwoods had really good pace and and a good strategy with a new soft but uh yeah uh very happy and uh encouraging start,0,Sainz
I'm going to overtake obviously when I have a chance and when it's safe and clean like it was today uh especially I had a good Pace I could extend my first stop so I had always a bit of a a tire advantage that I created for myself so the overtaking was always uh clean tidy and and safe which is uh the way I like to go racing,0,Sainz
I think I I've been in a one in years I as I said before you know every race I keep trying to prove to everyone what I'm capable of of doing and uh at the same time I've been so many years here that everyone knows more or less what I'm capable of doing one given the right uh yeah working environment the right tools to to fight you know and to is a good prove of it uh yeah as I said my future is something I'm not thinking about at the moment I think only about it in my off time the rest I'm focused in doing the races that I did today,0,Sainz
yep no and I put uh even harder work today it's just that it doesn't show no and unfortunately this is our our situation exactly what uh what I was talking about yesterday no we know race pace and high speed Corners it's our main weakness and unfortunately Barcelona has a high degradation tarmac a high degradation configuration and uh and a lot of high-speed Corners which is our main weakness and that's why today we were struggling so much out there and also with the predictability of the car and everything we were just I did everything I could I did the the most optimal driving and steams that I could do but unfortunately P5 was the best we could achieve,0,Sainz
we've identified our weaknesses and we exactly know where we are lacking and the feedback is there and and intention is there we just need time we need to keep trying keep bringing things to improve the package and um and yeah Mercedes today prove that they've done a good step and it's a good reference you know so um yeah we're gonna try our best I see the team United I see the team pushing flat out bagimaranello we probably just put the upgrade in the worst possible circuit for us which also doesn't doesn't help,0,Sainz
yeah I think we had a a strong first in then we were on for a a good result there at the beginning but unfortunately yeah we elected the route to to undercut try for the undercard and go short in the first team and then the race become just a bit too long in the medium and hard compounds today they were not performing well and um we were sliding a lot and yeah in the end the guys who went for the soft medium soft were we're on the better end and uh outperformed our strategy so yeah uh we tried everything but unfortunately there wasn't a way to be the Mercedes today,0,Sainz
nothing just a a good uh move in lap two and then uh I was trying to get Lis uh four or five laps later I was on the attack as I said we went for the undercut uh which worked but then they were just uh quicker and with fresher tires I couldn't keep them behind,0,Sainz
I think we should be a bit more competitive but it's clear that in tracks like Barcelona we still have a lot of work to do because we are not very competitive,0,Sainz
honestly a very a very unfortunate ending first of all I'm glad Checo and I are okay but uh yeah I drove a solid race I was very quick out there I was coming back in the top three fastest man on track for the last 20 20 laps but uh unfortunately after passing Checo into turn one and uh after fighting Charles in two turn two there was a very unexpected contact exit in turn two that honestly I still don't understand how how it happened didn't do any erratic Maneuvers any aggressive moving on Checo or anything like that and we for some reason that I don't understand still we we collided and uh that was the end,0,Sainz
I'm not sure honestly you never know what can happen but I this time I'm 100% convinced I didn't do anything wrong or anything aggressive so let's see,0,Sainz
"That's the plan, to turn it around in Singapore, thank you",0,Sainz
well I think a year is plenty of time no to for good things to happen still and a year in red where obviously we will try to give a our maximum for for this team for for for the team and for everyone at home and and in maranelo an important year ahead where we want to show progress and we want to be fighting for for more things than last year where I prepared myself the the best I could and I'm confident we can make step forwards ,0,Sainz
yeah if I'm honest Lawrence I only did an installation lab for F1 gigs that know what a installation lap is is just making sure all the systems work the car breaks turns and yeah steers and accelerates so you don't push it to the limit so it's impossible to to know if the car is uh a bit quick quicker much quicker a bit slower or whatever you know it's we until we don't push it that the limitting bin is impossible to know but we had no issues and the car is running smoothly so that's that's positive,0,Sainz
yeah I think me I've seen some very good progress here in the factory especially with uh with very clear ambitions and very clear targets of what we want to improve on this year's car a very clear leadership and uh I want to see obviously an improvement in the two main areas that we were weak last year which was U uh the drive the general drivability of the car I think you could see us quite on the edge last year with in qualifying laps and and race with having plenty of moments out there and then obviously the the race space uh race space I think is something that everyone needs to improve if we want to avoid the Max and Red Bull winning winning some extra races,0,Sainz
yeah I think this year I've changed quite a lot the way I I train and I've yeah rethought a bit about my my my my program for for a 24 race calendar which is I think is going to be the biggest challenge ever in form one for for drivers the cars are getting quicker they're getting more physical again and everyone I think is going to need to do a step forward this year I think I've made two in terms of preparation and uh I yeah I feel ready I've changed I'm doing a lot more cardio putting a lot of focus on on on that endurance to make sure also to recover well with jet lags and and uh and traveling which is going to be fundamental,0,Sainz
yeah I think we in general I had a solid year in 2023 um and uh we want to build up from that I think uh the important thing in in F1 is a bit what we did in silver in Singapore no when there's an opportunity to shine when there's an opportunity to win make sure we take it because uh it's that's what's going to keep us in in that uh in in that championship fight we have a chance to fight for it and then obviously keep becoming more and more consistent I think we did some progress also in that last year and um and the team was working really well towards the end so keep making that that progress,0,Sainz
well well first of all it was obviously a surprise no I think the the news surprised F1 world as much as it surprised me at at the time eh obviously I got to know earlier than than than than when the news went out so I was able to prepare and to analyze and think bad a bit about the situation for me um I'm only going to say that I'm proud you know of these three years that I've done with Ferrari proud of uh of of uh of being a Ferrari driver I think with still one year ahead there's still many good moments and many good things that could happen still with me in red and uh and yeah and you know I think life is long I think there's going to be very good opportunities out there in them in the in the Silly Season you know and I now it's time to to take an important decision for for myself and for the future,0,Sainz
yeah exactly you know I I know I've been performing in well recently you know and i' I know that there's going to be very good opportunities out there to to remain competitive in the future in other teams and uh now it's time as I said to analyze carefully listen a bit to to to everyone and know hear a bit from everyone and and make sure that I give myself some time to to know exactly what I want to do in the future where I want to go and where I'm going to spend my next uh who knows three four years of my career you know so it's an important decision I'm turning 30 this year which means I'm probably around my peak I think so uh I want to I want to make sure I keep myself some time and to analyze and and hear a bit everyone and see where where I can go,0,Sainz
yeah I think it's is not a lie that wherever I will go next I will look for stability and and and an interesting project to to become uh uh a champion with in the future I really believe in in stability I I'm a big believer in in in in consistency in getting to know the people you work with and getting yourself involved in the team that you're in for for more than one or two years so it's no secret that that is my my my preference and yeah that's why I need to keep myself of time to to decide well,0,Sainz
uh hopefully um Podium some wins and whether that takes us to a championship fight I will not know uh it is impossible to know uh but hopefully that should be progress compared to last year where we had a little bit of podiums and one win no so let's see also a more drivable car a car that I'm able to have fun with a car that I'm able to overtake unfortunately last year I was constantly defending in the races more than overtaking but uh yeah something that lets us play around a little bit more,0,Sainz
yeah thank you well uh first of all obviously I having a good moment right now but also obviously feeling well physically mentally and at one with a car helps you know to to have the head space and the mental space to to think about things or maybe think a bit out of the box sometimes and also Singapore is a layout that allows you know maybe to to play around a bit with with some different strategies and some different ways of driving and uh I knew that if I wanted to win win uh given our race space and tire degradation I needed to play a bit or think a bit out of the box to to win and uh the plan worked well,0,Sainz
yes it's been part of my driving style or part in inherited in me since uh since I'm a driver since I am an F1 driver let's say is my way of racing and I always try to to to find things or different things to do in this competitive world is difficult because everyone thinks a lot and everyone is very competitive and everyone tries toto find the smallest of advantages butuh this time as I said I felt good and Itrusted a bit that instinct and that and that uh mental space to to think a bit out the box and and it worked,0,Sainz
not really I'm not going to lie I've been driving well or I feel like I've been good with the car this year um since the very beginning it is just that the the first half of the season was a bit rough in terms of never putting a full weekend together I only had a couple of clean weekends in Spain and uh where was the other one I don't even remember Canada wasn't too bad I had a couple of clean clean weekends but not many and um I said okay this second half I'm going to check with my Engineers what we're doing well what we need to do better to make sure uh we start putting together more solid weekends from fp1 all the way to quali and and race day strategy race execution we need to start putting it together if we want to start getting good points and um we found a couple of things and since then we're executing them and to be honest in sanord is is working very well and uh it's been three three strong races for me,0,Sainz
no it's there's nothing really outstanding that I've changed it's uh in F1 my my my experience tells me it's all about the incremental gains and the small details no and just finding small details with the setup with the car handling finding small details of how to drive the car adapting my driving uh finding ways to execute a better race with strategy with Tire management with the tires in general with the fp1 fp2 be more open to try different things on the car and um putting all those things together they give you half a tenth that might be enough to qualify one position ahead and that half a 10th then and one that one position ahead makes your strategy a bit easier makes your race management a bit easier so it's all very very small things that suddenly come together and you start getting better results,0,Sainz
I think Charles and I have always been very good at being super competitive and super close to each other on track all the time we are within a tenth of each other you know doesn't matter who is ahead or who is a bit more comfortable with the car the other one is always one1 behind or half a tenth behind you know when that's always been the case and that helps to push the team forward and at the same time it helps us to to to push each other forward on the driving side and um the good thing is that we know we both have equal opportunity every given race day and uh we we complement each other very well we respect each other and and and we always prioritize Ferrari on top of everything,0,Sainz
yeah as much as there is no number one now there was no number one in 21 no number one in 22 we are not fighting for a championship so it's not like you really uh there's one guy that is fighting for a for a championship and the other one has to support you know it was me last year when he finished second in the championship that in ababi I went with a spirit of trying to help him and trying to help the team to get P2 uh in Singapore he was more on that Spirit of trying to help to get the win we are always Whoever has to do the job for the team and for Ferrari will do and um it's all about that compenetracion and that companerism we have,0,Sainz
for sure there there's a bit more glimmer of hope as you say know suddenly that we've been competitive at tracks or we've beaten Red Bull in qualifying at tracks where three races ago in sord when we were nearly a second off the pace was unthinkable no and even beating Red Bull in a race One race ago was Unthinkable because they were half a minute to a minute in front at the end of a races to all of a sudden go and and win a race it's something uh something different something that gives us hope and it shows us that um that we if we keep working well we can cut the Gap and and make it but at the same time as we go back to normal trucks uh that are not the mons as or Singapore that are maybe the two extremes we expect Red Bull to be dominant again and us to be having to do a perfect job to get in the podium,0,Sainz
I think I was pretty good in McLaren too it was just that it was in a Midfield car and I was finishing P5 P6 p7s and it was getting more less noticed no or maybe less less picked up because it was not for a race win but I've been doing races like in Singapore also in McLaren to win the Midfield battles and win the Midfield championships it was just no one watched everyone says it was never on TV but uh I'm not going to lie Singapore is if not my best weekend in have one one of the best 100%,0,Sainz
um I know that my good level is is very good and I and Singapore proofs it no when I'm driving at my top level I feel like I can beat anyone and I can be as good as anyone in this p it's just how often you manage to be in that level which is the difficult side of a formal One driver I think all of us at our Peaks we are very good talents and very good at everything we do uh it's just how consistent you can be at your peak and obviously that's the the never ending challenge of being a Formula One driver always trying to keep yourself in top form,0,Sainz
I'm excited it's still early days but the car for next year is already taking shape we have very clear targets of what we want to achieve into next year's car why we still even if I look like I'm reasonably comfortable in this year's car I'm not I'm it's still a car that gives us a lot of headaches when it comes to Tire degradation tie wear race space we still struggle and in Singapore I was in the fastest car on truck uh come race day and still we manag to win which is good progress for Ferrari also in terms of race execution and and race um strategy you know and it's all these Gams that we want to do on next year's car that will allow us hopefully to have a better race car next year and have to think less out of the box to to win the races,0,Sainz
Singapore but also monsa even sunboard with the wet conditions we got it right went to box when not to box that's why that's also something that needs to be picked up as much as Ferrari has always recently received a lot of criticism for those things I think it's time not to give a bit of credit on that side to the team we still have a lot of work to do don't don't worry we know that but um at least we we are on the right path,0,Sainz
yeah and I'm glad he was up there with me to to to celebrate because he's obviously a very special contributor to to the changes and the the direction we're following recently uh he's a very strong team leader that is giving us very good um feedback and very good uh directions to follow as a team and uh yeah hopefully we can keep it that way and he can uh also start to to feel more comfortable and uh be ready for for the next few challenges that are coming,0,Sainz
yeah it's a a really shame you know that the that it happened um yeah I mean um not really a lot I'm lot words to to say you know it's a a disaster for the championship for both of us to end up a weekend like this uh where we definitely had a lot more on the table it's a a bit of a disaster,0,Checo
I think in in uh in my opinion um um Carlos moved too quickly um to follow the toe from uh from Charles so I think I do expect that uh I mean it it was just wrong time wrong moment and uh we got some work to do we sing with Max today you know a small setup difference and you are out of the window very quickly so uh yeah plenty of work to do going forwards hard luck thank you,0,Checo
yeah unfortunately uh we just not we were not able to maximize the result today it was a shame and um yeah it's now time to look forward for for for the the rest of the season because today was a a nightmare. A total nightmare a disaster uh with the balance I the struggle a lot yeah,0,Checo
I think yeah yeah unfortunately but in say we probably went went on too long unfortunately and that meant that we we lost out,0,Checo
"I think we we need a good upgrade, I think the the the coming trucks should should be better for us so hopefully we are able to to have a better package coming up",0,Checo
yeah it was a really bad uh but race for us um it started well on the first stint but um then the second stint was really complicated with the going onto the medium compound um that really hurt a lot you know when when uh I had to push and the gradation was just quite High and um yeah we had to do quite a short extin unfortunately and uh that compromise I think the the race time um  but ultimately we didn't have the pace today,0,Checo
yeah I've said it before you know I don't think I will be responding anymore to to any future speculation I'm I'm here with the team fully committed I think as a team we have a lot of stuff to focus on uh to get ourselves ready for this second half of the season I think uh I've had enough of this speculation I've said everything I had to and um yeah so uh it's time to take a break and uh regroup with the team and then get back to it,0,Checo
yeah yeah I don't know how to call it but uh a super weekend you know a weekend that uh I think with the limit on the pressure massively because every single session was so critical on this format you know it was really important to be able to to deliver when it matter you know I think yesterday we executed a perfect shot race and today once again we executed a tremendous race you know um that first thing to me was a key to my victory,0,Checo
I think generally speaking it's uh it's a truck where you require a lot of confidence you know a lot of corners  and um yeah you see that a lot of drivers clip goals during the race so I think it's all about confidence building that confidence lap of the lap and making sure you are on top of your car,0,Checo
yeah exactly I think if you know having three kids at home I wouldn't be traveling the world around the if I didn't believe that I can be a world champion and uh I'm working through towards that but obviously I mean there is so much you can talk outside the car I think it's important to deliver on the track and I think without the issues we have in qualifying in Melbourne we should be leading the championship so definitely there is everything to to believe that we can do well this year,0,Checo
yeah I was but it's one thing to have the pace another one to not to make mistakes and the third one is to have that pace with with the good management of the tires you know because I know Max and I know the way he pushes you to to take off and yeah it wasn't an easy an easy Victory because all already from the first end we were pushing massively each other  and on that second thing was it was the same so it was pretty much a race between us from a start to the end ,0,Checo
I think to be honest it's a it's a great relationship between me Max and myself  because although not many people believe we are very similar you know we have a life out of the sport and we when we are at home we we pretty much disconnect from it so um when we are on track we we come try to do the best possible job we try to reach each other I'm sure Max will look at my data I will look at his and we we are just pushing each other massively  and I think I think this year it's about not making those mistakes,0,Checo
I'm fighting for it you know but I also know that it's a long a massive uh road ahead  so I I need to keep my head down and just keep delivering,0,Checo
yeah yeah I remember the moment when basically I wasn't told what to do you know when we were just having a chat there and um with other the drivers and so on and I thought it was going to be a normal you know presentation normal parade and then all of the then I get someone shouting at my name and and I see him you know it was quite a funny moment,0,Checo
yeah it was pretty cool obviously with it's such an icon Bruce that was really really cool and um at the time I was just confused you know I had no idea where to go what to do um and um and then uh leis was looking for a lift because his car was not working so he took my car so we ended up going on both on on on on my car um it was quite a funny a funny day,0,Checo
um at the moment it's it's in in my room every time we at at my room at home we try I haven't brought it to I want to send it back to the office uh but we have and still still there at the room it's at a risky place you know with the kids they keep playing with it it`s still alive,0,Checo
it's just that when we arrive we we left it there and normally we have a like a like a a place like a family room and where we put all our trophies with my with my son and uh we we put it we put them on up there,0,Checo
uh around the 20th of December yeah because we had the we were quite busy after the season with Japan we had to go to Honda and um the the gala and then the team we had some celebration down in Milton Kings so it was really 20s or so of December,0,Checo
it's great it's um basically all the Honda drivers get together it's a massive event and as you can imagine the the fidget circuit is pretty much full and um the energy of the Japanese fans is is great  it was the bike from Mark he was explaining me how he does it and um we do some carting with the with Daniel with juki with Max so it's pretty cool event,0,Checo
it's hard to disconnect because you are always thinking what went wrong right wrong what you can improve how you can be a better driver how you can prepare better for next season so it's it's it's always in the back of your mind although um luckily uh when I'm home I I can be really far away and I have a life out of the sport but at the end of the day this is my life you know and I want to be the best possible I I possibly can so um it's it's difficult to to separate but um at times it's it works well and and when I'm at home I'm fully fully into my family and into my friends and uh yeah no not much formula one,0,Checo
oh on the break I don't train I don't train at all uh I try to but I think I went to the gym once or twice so not much uh,0,Checo
no I mean the thing is that we get back to it in January so effectively you get to two maximum three weeks of doing nothing it's very hard to lose any form you know you lose some but we do so much training when the when the year starts that uh doesn't change,0,Checo
same Hobbies uh golf carting now I'm more into carting with my son um we go together to to race football we play a lot of football now uh together and um basically my biggest hobby is to be with my family,0,Checo
he likes go but he doesn't have time to to play at the moment because he's so busy with football with football and and carting that he is really hard to get another sport,0,Checo
for for now it's just a hobby I mean it's a six-year-old kid he really likes it he enjoys it he's very competitive but um it's up to him um to do it I I will support him on anything that he wants to do of course but um it will be up to him,0,Checo
I think I was really lucky in a way on on on my carting carting days because um I couldn't afford to go to Europe to Italy so basically all my carting was on in Mexico um but I was always raising guys with a lot older ages than than myself so that was a good thing you know it kind of of um complemented in a in a way you know the lack of not being with in Europe with the Italian drivers with all the European drivers they they have a pretty high level um I will have love to to to to drive carting you know and in in Europe but we couldn't afford it so I think we there's nothing we we did wrong in my carting days with the opportunities that we have obviously I lack the opportunity to to do carting in Italy I think that would have helped a lot in those early days but we never had the opportunity,0,Checo
um well if he if he wants to at the moment he's racing mainly at my at my carting Tru with like 10 to 20 other other kids and um and yeah we'll see you know I think he he will do some later on some races in probably in the in the US in Mexico and then we see um when we come to Europe I think he will do some some more carting over here and um if he really wants to do it then I think once you go into into Italy you know he will have to to really see if he likes it or not,0,Checo
it's a massive a massive effort you know the only reason I'm here is because all all my family all together uh we gave it all and if that's his dream I think to me happiness is about pursuing your your dreams and if that's his dream I will support him although it it it hurts a lot you know to to lose a son that goes so early away but it will it will help him in the his character regardless of if he makes it or not into the sport into formula one it will help him so much you know so I will be really really proud for for for him to to pursue his dreams,0,Checo
"I I was lucky to be sponsored by Carlos liim so you need to ask him but it was a lot because even him was complaining at the time you know so he must have been a lot like uh I remember one it was like 200 200,000 pesos mil pesos which is like 10,000 Euros",0,Checo
I'm pushing my daughter you know I really want to get her into into carting but um she just likes to go and watch her her brother but she's afraid she and I don't want to push her too much so I would love to and the the the younger Olivia it's still a baby but um I mean I will be happy I think it's just whatever they like to do I will just support them as much as I can and and try to be with them,0,Checo
uh positive I think we we made a step forwards um there's plenty of you know when you've done a a test in in in Bahrain it's probably one of the hardest tracks to test you know because the truck is changing uh I'm sure you've seen the graphic it goes like 2 seconds through the the day so it's just every run so different so every change you make it's it really has to be based on your feeling regardless of the lap time sometimes you you are like this didn't feel great but you are half a second faster it's like well it does feel great you know so uh it's quite difficult to to test but um I think we just have to wait and see I'm positive for the season and um and looking forward to start,0,Checo
no it did especially with my program I had I basically went straight into long run um and I was like uh just dialing in obviously a new car figuring how to drive it and so on so I think we made some good progress we've understand quite a lot and uh I mean we are so limited on testing that we did the most we could ,0,Checo
I think that we we just improved in all areas we've done a step forward um and it's all relative you know I think also the competition has done a step forward so it's going to be a an interesting Championship ,0,Checo
yeah definitely I believe Ferrari are looking good uh from what I've seen so far um Mercedes um we haven't seen much of uh Aston and McLaren at the moment and like I said you know it's so hard to to know but they will be they will be up there I mean I will expect quite a a close fight,0,Checo
basically was when uh early in January yeah yeah it was the first what was your first reaction well when you see it in drawings it's hard to pick up you know to to notice I I could see that it was a difference but I thought it was just a an evolution rather than when I see it for the first time it was like wow this is a very different concept ,0,Checo
it's everyone at Red Bull really the the philosophy of the team is just pushing us as much as possible regardless of if we are winning um I think it's it's only Red Bull who will have just chosen to go that path you know after having such a dominant year,0,Checo
a lot more a lot more comfortable a lot better in the team um understanding a lot more the the Red Bull philosophy of uh setups and stuff I think every every year you spend with a team is just better and better because uh people sort of forget how how long it takes to get fully up to speed with a with a culture of car of concept because all the cars out there are really close but um how they get them the lap time a shied is super different across teams,0,Checo
it used to be a little bit more separate I think later on especially as GP moved you know Max's race engineer it's our chief engineer uh right now so I think everything is coming more together and trying to to work a lot more closer both cars uh both engineers and um I think that that has helped the the team lately and I I think it's something that is going to help through this year you know to to have that Evolution together and um just being being working a lot closer,0,Checo
well I know GP GP was my race engineer back in 2014 um at force India India yeah so I know him well I mean um he's one of my my friends in in the sport so um I know him pretty well,0,Checo
yeah I think it helps the fact that I I knew GP from before and um and obviously now his position he's not just max Max's race engineer he's also a chief engineer so it helps you know to have that dialogue between us,0,Checo
I think just maximizing every single opportunity you know it's a 24 races calendar you know and and just being able to from race one hit it a track race by race you know and and have that Evolution and just maximizing the opportunities because I know if I'm able to do that I will have a great year,0,Checo
yeah there were reasons for it obviously it's not like I forget to drive from one weekend to the other there were reasons behind it we understood them and I think we are in a better in a better shape,0,Checo
I think basically just uh being able to focus on the right approach for the entire weekend you know getting getting quality done properly making that progression I think what happened last year was that we lacked a lot of progression through the weekend and I think being able to to dial in um improving from sat Friday to Saturday Saturday to Sunday making those jumps through the weekend will be key because we always started strong but we sort of stay there so it's it's just important having that Revolution and um working together with the simulator as well you know to try to to have a good base back back there in Milton Kings,0,Checo
I think that he's really at one with the car you know like um with the team he's at the at the moment of of his life you know he's in top form and um he comes to a weekend and he knows exactly what what he needs to to go fast and keeps improving keeps making it faster,0,Checo
um doesn't make mistakes often and I,0,Checo
think he's just uh very tough very tough to be you know and um we will try and give it a goal last year we started really close very closely match and this year we we'll see how we start and um how we are within the first few races,0,Checo
very important you know these first few races are super important you know because U it really puts you in on on a pair you know to to your teammate so these few first few races are very important,0,Checo
yeah I felt like the car was just as it start to evolve it just went out of me as even on the simulator like I will jump in and within a lap I will be like not focusing so much on getting the lap time it was more about developing the car but as the car developed I will jumped in the seam and I will be like just chasing the lap time you know and and U it wasn't coming so naturally as it was coming in early in the season so you start to make compromises to make you feel comfortable and in that window of making me feel more comfortable I think we we made the car slower on our side and it's something we understood ,0,Checo
it was difficult you know because especially as you having such an dominant teammate that is is winning all the time but you are not able to extract the maximum out of the car you know and then um it's not an easy situation but um I thing is when you have to be just mentally strong focus on yourself and make sure that you are you give your best and and and be able to deliver when you can,0,Checo
I think it helps to understand a perspective from the outside you know because sometimes we we get dragged in into it so much that um at times it's it's good to have someone that understands the sport that knows what's going on and um can be from the outside just having that conversation and then just making you realize that oh probably this is this is wrong or this is right having a different perspective from someone from the outside I think it's always helpful,0,Checo
no basically I mean um one thing is that mentally you have to be strong and making sure that you focus on the right stff you know because in Formula 1 there are so many distractors around and and people that are experts all around the world and they they know exactly what's going on and you but you are inside and you have no clue um so just making sure you focused on your job it's a main key and um don't let any noise or any of the outside noise um influencing any of your decision I think that's the key,0,Checo
oh God I'm so terrible at this um relaxed fun uh chaos ,1,Lando
what made me fall in love um um I mean I I fell in love with uh with racing um with driving um I like cars and I'm just driving so I wouldn't say like I fell in love with Formula 1 and then decided to try get in Formula 1 you know I was like 7 6 5 years old so I fell in love with four wheels MH actually I fell in love with two wheels then four wheels um but I think just kind of being out there alone just you in control um um uh yeah just driving as quickly as you can um I think I think that and just uh just um being at one with the car kind of thing like I would say I would say that that's what I fell in upated and then Formula 1 is just the most extreme part of it you know the most extreme version of that but um I fell in love with carting and uh then they ended up in Formula One,1,Lando
I see I see Alex crying a lot I know what it is it was a lawn mower I used to drive the lawn mower I used to um I used to go and cut the grass every day just so I could drive the lawn mower um but there's like a weight limit to start the engine so I had to always go to the gym and get the 10 kilo dumbbells which were basically a a third of my body weight back then um I had to put them on the seat with me and then to sit on them to allow me to actually start it and drive so uh it all started on the lawn mower,1,Lando
I I do try to avoid that now at all costs um yeah love a little valet you know,1,Lando
um I think I have Carlos i' have uh I love Max just for the vibe he won't be allowed to hold a golf club or anything but you know just to have uh yeah he can get the the drinks and that kind of thing um and uh who else um I I think Lance is pretty good at golf Lance is very good at golf similar to Carlos almost so I I would put uh for a competition those two and then Max you know Max can drive the golf buggy um kind of caddy and do that kind of thing ,1,Lando
tough uh I mean I've I've worked and almost probably been been closest to to Carlos but for people that I've not worked with I've probably closest to Max I would say um just cuz we we kind of grew up together-ish and I mean we knew of each other many many years ago 20 2012 2013 um but I've never actually worked with Max or been you know same team or anything like that but uh I've always had a you know a good respectful relationship with Max but Carlos is the one that I've been teammates with I kind of know probably personally more than anyone else um even you know his cousin kako and that kind of thing uh yeah so I would probably say Carlos,1,Lando
um I'm I mean I'm very happy with Zach uh I mean he's team boss obviously team principal still um Mr Stella but uh as a boss sack is good and he's a golfer too so you know when your boss says do you want to go play golf it's like um uh and drivers um uh Jackie Stewart I just want yeah I love Jackie so I Jackie Stewart um and I want to drive alongside Jackie so put myself,1,Lando
Danny Rick Danny Rick was I feel like he talks a big game you know with music and knows everyone and all that kind of thing so Danny Daniel Daniel's in there karaoke I think then Yuki I think I think Yuki is a bit of a karaoke guy yeah um so he might be the main main act main main part um Lewis actually sings as well isn't he yeah yeah oh Lou um yeah so him and Yuki then you got Charles on the piano um I can do a bit of drumming yeah very simple but just the beat um I think that's that's a good group yeah any thoughts on the name and Daniel's there somewhere yeah doing lighting or something um schnitzels,1,Lando
just have fun it's like the most boring one but life's too short,1,Lando
I don't think there's anything is bad advice such thing as bad advice,1,Lando
I'm very picky with my food so when someone gives me something especially when it's in a packet don't trust it that means it's been tampered with yeah so the only thing I accept uh from a food point of view you is a strip waffles and Kinder maxis and Kinder Eggs,1,Lando
I mean he's the one who got me into DJing so I give full credits to Martin um yeah yeah,1,Lando
um I would just say just keep grinding away yeah I wouldn't say keep believing cuz I think that's nonsense I didn't believe I was going to be in F1 and I'm here so uh I don't think you need to believe in yourself to be honest um I think it helps and maybe it's a good thing but I don't think you need it um some people maybe like it more than others um but as long as you're working hard in the meantime uh I think that's the most important thing so I worked hard to be here but uh I didn't believe I would be here so yeah I think that's really the best thing,1,Lando
yeah where would I like to be uh still here Formula 1 I don't know to be honest I'm not sure I don't know,1,Lando
um I'm excited beginning of 2023 um full of unknowns new car new livery new helmet new everything so uh this is like the most exciting but unknowing unknown times so I love it I love the beginning of the season,1,Lando
a mix of a mix of Italian with Japanese with a mix of uh Chinese and you just mix those three together I think you got an interesting combo,1,Lando
what was I listening to I see one called antisocial is what I am I I don't know the name of who sings it but it was uh when I was in Dubai founded in Dubai that's what we listened to every car Journey it was antisocial,1,Lando
my favorite thing in the winter break I was going to Finland uh basically everything that we did in Finland I did Ice rallying ice karting ice driving snowmobiling husky riding I didn't do skiing sadly uh yeah going to Finland I'll just say as a whole going to Finland,1,Lando
to be honest we're so busy with formula one there's not many things you get to do outside of race but uh the obvious one is quite expand quadrant bring on more people um make all the videos more content whatever it is quadrant is going to be bigger and better this year so that's number one number two there is a number two,1,Lando
tough one proudest um proudest moment uh my first podium I don't know if that's like just best moment or proudest first party with Formula One um the one two we had in Monza for McLaren like there's a team thing that's probably that meant even more,1,Lando
uh I do I'm actually wearing it right now it's a bit more like casual more chilled not like F1 racing cars but like no just tough hopefully you don't mind to wear more at home chilling out yeah more casual Vibes rather than racing Vibes it is out now uh I'm sure there's gonna be a link below in the description but you can only buy it once you subscribe to this YouTube account yeah that's how it works and now nowadays I'm afraid so you have to subscribe to the YouTube channel then you can go on to the store um and then you can buy it if you want it,1,Lando
um because Ash made me choose it I didn't really want it but Ashley made me choosing them before so yeah I mean that that's the reason right because it just looked good in the logo because I wanted number 46. 46 I didn't want 46 but the number I grew up with was 46.  but I never had any number which meant anything to me because I changed like janetra had 11 I think then I had 31. uh in F4 I had 31 I think that in F3 um F2 I had then two I think or something you know I had maybe 11. um so I didn't know what to do but now I've done before just because I mean it goes perfectly with the logo L N 4.,1,Lando
but you can just name one I think three's quite a lot something on my bucket list yeah higher balloon okay I think I just don't have a bucket list so I don't know what to say that's my bucket list maybe my bucket list to make a bucket list,1,Lando
first Contender is Japanese Grand Prix 2019 second Contender is Mexico actually my favorite all-time in surrounding generosity the blue and yellow 100 in 2019 2019 was a good year pretty much had a new helmet every single race um but of those the ones I love the Japanese one uh because it's hand painted very different all the rest of them and Mexico one just because it's colorful bright uh seems just good good fun good looking helmet that's it,1,Lando
it's delicious yeah I'm excited every day to have it I used to have like a wrap or I say it is around it's a wrap of that,1,Lando
am I willing to tell them or oh this one it's actually a new one um from my grandma she gave it to me for Christmas um the next one from a fan this one uh also from a fan this one I bought myself I don't know why just thought I would and treats myself and that's it,1,Lando
same old same old I don't really need to change too many things to be honest just keep working keep doing what I have been doing but also do even more help the team more work even harder help in more areas um and lead in as many ways as I can simple as that,1,Lando
one of the nicest ones is the one I've got I've got a Max when we're playing golf um he's just walking like a like the opposite side of a little Pond from me so it has him and then obviously the reflection of him in the water so when you flip it it's that clear it's hard to see which one's actually the real one versus uh the reflective one nice that's a nice one um and then probably something for my last trip in Finland with like white backgrounds and snow everywhere uh then the contrast of people in jackets and stuff in different colors,1,Lando
uh the thing I've improved the most on probably like uh mentally coping with all the different situations things going on strategy looking after tires fuel uh focusing on the race racing people while doing that um just mentally coping with all of these things and being able to go from chatting to someone five minutes before the race to then suddenly clicking putting your helmets on and then only thinking off of the race so going from like relaxed to Game Face kind of thing um I can get into that easier and change into that easier and quicker,1,Lando
what is that that's not human it's sick but I'm doing ghost listening to wherever it's called ghost hunting,1,Lando
so chaps uh we got time for today uh question wise thank you for sending in so many questions um we do one last time one last question one last question what's one last question Ash he's not prepared sorry sorry about this,1,Lando
uh I don't know I think I would just want to go back to being like super young like back to when I was you know four five six years old or something and compare that to where I am now just to see the difference of when you're a kid versus when you're an adult but uh that's it I think nice otherwise my podium in Austria um that's all so that was it that was the last question that's it that was a good one good one to end up but yeah we've been shooting my merch today new merch uh it's out now once again uh in store click on the link below in the description but that's all seasons starting soon um back in the race car very soon so hold once again see you very soon cheers everyone bye-bye,1,Lando
"yeah, I thought it was um I thought it was a good race until then clearly a little bit on the back in terms of overall pace comparing to Max you know the first and second stint he would always just edge away that little bit little bit but they just seem to make a lot more mistakes and what we did, you know they mess up their Pit Stop which is rare from them but clearly a bit of pressure from their side and they started to slip up a little bit um but I felt like I drove a good race you know I kept myself in the fight the whole time, it was very difficult on track to make easy to make mistakes, difficult to drive because of the wind and conditions and things like that, just feel let down, you know a lot of damage to the car, the car's completely destroyed now so in some type forance I think it's a shame. ",1,Lando
"still I got back to the pits in a better way, I could have probably gone out and gotten some points but the car was too badly broken so I don't know. what I meant to say I did all I could. I gave a fair respect you know on the edge of Battle but that's not what I got in return.",1,Lando
"it's not for me to say, it's for him to say something, I did nothing wrong. He was the one in the wrong so he's the one that should say something not me.",1,Lando
"I mean a lot of it was pretty straight forward and I was very comfortable with the course, there were a couple moments which were a little bit too close for my liking um but it was good you know the car has been Mega all weekend I feel like I've been in good form the whole weekend I've been able to just be comfortable and execute well and get the most out of the car um even when it's not been easy to drive, it's been easy to make mistakes and things and a couple of those mistakes I paid the price for today but we were just quick you know and as soon as I got back in a good rhythm we were quick again so uh was a good day it's been a great weekend in fact um mistake free really from my side apart from a couple things today and a weekend executed exactly how I planned for and exactly how I want to I want to execute weekends but nevertheless still a tough one and not easy even with how quick we've been so a satisfying one.",1,Lando
"mentally tough you know physically tough sweating a lot it's pretty hot in the car it's extremely hot in the car actually you know like we're in tough conditions for us as drivers is it's not easy this is um it doesn't look it on the TV but let me let me assure you inside the car it's it's tougher than a lot of sports and um it's tougher than what it looks and we're performing at the top level of what we can perform as humans it's why we're athletes but that's the task you know that's my job is to make sure I'm fit and performing well and that is a little bit part of it especially on a race weekend like we have today and a race like we had today, but it's tough to manage as soon as you relax a little bit too much you can make mistakes because you're not focused and as soon as you push a little bit too hard you can also make mistakes you know so it's a challenge it's not easy out there but it's good fun ",1,Lando
"I mean I would have the fastest SLP but Daniel got me at the end so I'll give it to him you know but I would have loved to I mean it's been a great weekend for F1 I was second but the rest we've been on top and we've been quickest so would have it was nice to do the whole thing together but this is what I got to do, it is what I need it's what we need to do as a team I mean we've executed things perfectly as a team and especially to get Oscar go P3 today but we need to do it every race till the end of the year if I want to have a chance to get Max but we're working hard and if I keep doing one of them this weekend then it's definitely possible.",1,Lando
um honestly I don't know I mean turn one ruined my chances of everything uh I went off in turn one uh I just tried to avoid any contact with people on the inside and I just misjudged the curb and then I bottomed out on the curb and I've gone off so a bit stupid honestly uh almost embarrassing um actually was embarrassing but um the pace was very good the the car performed well actually felt pretty comfortable out there and in in good shape um just overtaking was impossible so bit stuck ,1,Lando
uh no not really they had track position from the beginning and track position was uh was King today so um no I thought everyone just uh doubts them doubts what Mercedes can do they've been almost just as quick as us for the last month um just everyone underestimates what they can do and on a day like today they just do what they are very capable of doing and um it's a good job so fair play to them ,1,Lando
wasn't even a battle I couldn't even get close so I was close just you lose like a 1 second in Middle sector following and you can't do anything after that so bit frustrating um couldn't make more progress cuz I felt like the pace was good in the car but um just not the pace to uh to go forward,1,Lando
I think the only positive to take is that we have good reliability but everyone around us did too so um ultimately I think we we didn't have the race best today I'm not quite sure why I think even if IID started further ahead would have been hard to have even if I was ahead of Ferrari Ferraris or they would have out ahead they just had more Pace than us so but they had an upgrade this weekend and we didn't and so it's just how it goes there'll be a race hopefully that we'll have an upgrade and others won't and we'll be stronger maybe but uh it's very very fine um margin small margins yeah between all us uh and yeah unfortunately today we just didn't have the pace we had more de than the cars ahe I could have probably done a one stop but I would have come out the exact same place,1,Lewis
I don't know I think I mean look at the race Trace I think McLaren had the pace they just pushed too hard they were doing much too faster laps early on and killed their tyres and and they I guess they they literally had planned for a two stop that's why they were pushing so hard they just backed off and gone longer they could for sure have made a One Stop um but I could tell I I was getting the information of the ti The Times They were doing and there's no way your tyres are going to last at that pace um and um Charles did a fantastic job today so really well done to him for us uh uh we were planning to do a one stop my tyres were just dropping off just trying to hold on to uh to Carlos so uh definitely unexpected but as I said they had an upgrade this weekend so it was inevitable they would be quick compared to us but uh yeah we wish I wish we were closer and more in the fight but um onwards and upwards,1,Lewis
yeah can't stop crying I think uh you know it's been since 2021 I just every day getting up trying to fight to train to put my mind to the task and work as hard as I can with this this amazing team and this is my last race here at the British Grand Prix with this team so uh I wanted to win this so much for them because I love them I appreciate them so much all the hard work they've been putting in all over these years I'm forever grateful to to everyone in this team everyone at Mercedes and all of our partners and uh and then otherwise too all our incredible fans I could see you lap by lap as I was coming around and there there's just no greater feeling as to to finish at the front here ,1,Lewis
I it's so tough I think for anyone um but I think the important thing is just how you continue to get up and and you got to continue to dig deep even when you feel like you're at the bottom of the barrel I mean there's definitely been days between 2021 in here where I didn't feel like I was good enough or whether I was going to get back to where I am today but the important thing is I had great people around me continuing to support me my team every time I turn up and see them putting in the effort that really encouraged me to do the same thing and and otherwise my fans when I see them around the world they have been so supportive so uh a big big thank you to everybody back at the factory everyone here I love you guys and God bless you ,1,Lewis
and after a bad start to recover and get back into P3 is really really really great job really happy with particularly my second and last stint were very very strong and I think the first one I was just recovering from such a bad start so uh that was a little bit more tricky but yeah uh we're getting there we're getting closer and big big thank you to the team because we're slowly closing the Gap ,1,Lewis
yeah uh with George well firstly with with Carlos um I mean they short in the DRS so not so easy to follow through the last corner and I really had to pull this move off as early as possible and so he he moved over but didn't completely the inside so I went for the inside um and yeah was very very close you know very close between us he tried to hold hold and stay on the outside but um I left him a little bit of room but uh it was nice and nice and tight ,1,Lewis
ah this is the best weekend I've had all year so and for a long long time for like 15 races or something crazy so it's good to to be back it's good to have battles like today it's good to reassert and reaffirm thanks,1,Lewis
I hope so the last race is the cars have not been too bad it's just the other's been faster so I think this this weekend I think the Red Bulls are going to be um particularly quick I think they're going to be the really hard ones to beat with their package has been great in a lot of the races this year so um time will tell ,1,Lewis
no I think I think it it does change it's changed quite a bit they're a lot more lenient a lot more relaxed on the rules that were previously set it's not really a ruling rules aren't really there anymore so um but fair play. ,1,Lewis
it kind of seems like it really but you know maybe they wake up on the wrong a different side of the bed and then you'll get the rule for the role that they they had written but uh the penalty for the rule they've written but um all right it looks like they're being more lenient and just not bothering with a lot of the rules now so that's good for the driver to know and you maybe position yourself slightly different you could be more aggressive and not have to worry um of the consequences necessarily but what president Matt sets will be interesting ,1,Lewis
it will definitely it will definitely come up um you know obviously we're dealing with the different um head of stewarding as well you know different philosophy from you know we had Charlie for so long who was really at the Pinnacle of that and now it shifted and um so just would be interesting to see how what the trend is moving forwards um and all he ever asked was consistency but if they're they're not throwing penalties at the rules that they've written before then there is that would be the consistent trend and if racing is people who enjoy that more no problem we'll rest at that,1,Lewis
uh i don't necessarily have an update for you what i can say is that there's um constant constantly a lot of work going on in the background and the goal is to have something to to deliver hopefully i think um i think it's june or July i've been on plenty of commission calls um that again the goal is to make sure that this is not just like any other uh commission is something that actually really delivers and um we're able to kind of come up with recommendations understand what those barriers are and so you can fully address them and create pathways for minorities to come into stem subjects ,1,Lewis
well i'm fully invested in in this season and and in delivering i still love what i do um i think i you know going back to earlier on just generally in a fortunate position that i don't have to commit to multiple years so i chose to have a one-year deal so then i could see how the year goes and where the where where we're at mid mid-year or towards the end of the year who knows whether we'll be in still in a pandemic and yeah so um but it doesn't mean i'm not committed i'm still very very committed to to the sport what i'm really focused on is is trying to make sure that in last year you all wrote some really great reports i think there was a lot of great discussion around this diversity issue and it still remains an issue to this day and it's not going to change overnight but it's what's really important is to make sure that we are actually delivering and actually taking action and i'm really really proud of of my team here who i'm already seeing steps that we're that we started taking last year towards particularly towards the end of the year we're starting to see that progress you know little by little and it just takes one step at a time of course so that's kind of my driving force this year too to make sure that um we continue to push for accountability and and um and on top of that hopefully i can deliver some good performances,1,Lewis
yeah absolutely that's a good point and i going back to you know as i said you know i'm very very proud of mercedes for being open-minded uh to change and really not just taking the smallest of steps really taking a step back seeing what we can do they've we've done a real deep dive into what we can do here at the not only at the factories but back at mercedes-benz and so for them to be open to to putting a foundation together and really putting some um money towards pushing for real systematic change within our own organization i think is is fantastic and if we really do do what we're planning to do i really think we're going to create and open up pathways for young minorities to get into stem subjects and and i'm really hopeful that in the future we see it just being more diverse because it just it works out better for everyone,1,Lewis
um that's not really been discussed and i don't really know what i could what i would be doing differently of course safety is going to be key and of course i do not want to miss a single race this year so i think we did 99 99 of the time or 99.8 whatever it was last year was pretty spot-on in terms of how um we conducted ourselves and and we're just really really unlucky it's difficult to be 100 safe as you know but it will be a i would imagine reduced travelling will be a lot of time at home in a small a small bubble like everyone else is working on and that's kind of it for now but i will coordinate with the team what is the best way forwards,1,Lewis
what's success off track like yeah so non-racing non-performance like um i think it's working on partnerships it's uh collaborations i have um in the past I've particularly like at the beginning of last year collaborations with tommy hilfiger I've had designed a clothes collection that i got to be fully hands-on and really uh get to design everything with the team so there's a lot of a learning process with that i got to push it to be sustainable for example the last collection was 80 using the sustainable materials and some of them were and so that's for me when you get at the end of the year and you see the result of something that you've been working on um whilst you know alongside something else that you're fully focused devoted to that feels successful you know that for that for example was unisex it was open to everyone um last year i i started off the year and you know i made a post i didn't know what reaction what the reaction would be i wasn't really expecting anything back but i was really kind of blown away to see the response and then kind of the steps that were taken after and as i said now i'm i'm back at my team i see already change in the system and plans being made and that for me is success in the in the in the background where you're actually impacting people's lives,1,Lewis
uh time will tell i guess i mean it's not like it's my first rodeo i think i've been in this position where at least i've been asked a question for a period of time so um yeah i don't really feel pressured in that sense i mean naturally i have continued to have a huge belief in and and always better myself um in terms of i know what it takes to deliver and i think i have an extraordinary relationship with mercedes that's incredibly deep and i think there's there's more than just this racing that we will probably end up doing together as you're already seeing with this foundation there's a lot of there's a lot of great things that we can do moving forward so that would be a constant discussion through the year i'm sure and um and in terms of whether i want to just whether this is where i want to continue the is if this is the road that i want to continue down it will come to me i'm sure,1,Lewis
what uh it's a good question i think what I've made a really important decision in my mind is that that's i don't want that to be the deciding factor um i got into racing because i loved racing and i think that's got to always be at the core of what i do like if i don't love racing if you start if all you're going for is accolades before you're going for his titles i think he can kind of i don't know i feel like i could potentially lose my way so it's it's um of course it's the ultimate dream but i'm not really i don't think that's necessarily going to be the one the deciding factor whether i stay or keep going um i think it's more whether i'm when i put that helmet on i'm still it's still i still have that smile when i leave the garages whether you know it's going back to do you enjoy it and you know last year was a a really tough year for everyone including me and but i think it was there was some really impactful moments will that be the case this year we'll see will i enjoy it as much we'll see i mean i'm excited now currently so i'm sure i will um so yeah,1,Lewis
well as you may or may not know i don't really do simulator stuff so um i've done i have not done a lot of laps on the simulator maybe uh i'll be guessing i've maybe done 30 laps or something like that the problem so my the problem with the sim for example is we've got a new tire this year so they can send an idea of what the tire model is but it's we want we won't know until we get to the track and we test the tire when we get to bahrain and then i can come then i'll feed back the information of,1,Lewis
how the tire behaves through the corners then it can update the sim and i really kind of need to be here to to update it to say yes that's how it feels at the track so right now it's a it's a kind of guesstimate of what the tire might feel like also the error package has shifted but that combined with those tires,1,Lewis
it just i don't like to take too much from it so we have lost a rear downforce and that can play a significant role especially with the tyres dropping off in performance also with these new pirellis they're more reliable or supposed to be more reliable but they have less grip and i think they're probably around eight tenths off um the last year's tires so undoubtedly the rear of the car could potentially be sliding around more and more thermal degradation this year so you might see more stops potentially but that's all guessing really maybe others have lost less downforce and maybe they'll be in a better position,1,Lewis
um i mean ultimately to each their own i think to i mean everyone has to make their own decision i think it's um a symbolic gesture and i think that it at certain times it can be really impactful i think we're entering into another year at the moment it's not been decided what we'll do but we i think we're all meeting when we get to um to Bahrain so i'm sure that'll be part of the discussion with stefano for example and i think it's i don't think it's the most important thing that everyone goes and takes the knee i think it's more the action that we take in the background you know and it is true at the moment that we what's really important is that things pass and things die down it's important to continue to it is it continues to be an issue that that affects my day-to-day life and so many people out there and i think that it's really important just to continue having that conversation you know going back to that accountability thing really continuing to hold uncomfortable conversations with people because um change is possible and change is needed so um yeah we'll see how we can collectively work together to have to make sure we're more leaders we're leading more in this sport and and it's not necessarily having to be taking the knee if you know what i mean,1,Lewis
um in terms of the other drivers i mean it's it ultimately is down to them what they decide to do um i think you saw last year there was obviously a mixture in in terms of some of us taken on the in some not um as opposed to sometimes you've seen another sports where everyone was united together i think but again it's it's it is down to choice it is down to um education i think is a is a part of it what are what i want to see and and i would like to see is just it's creating opportunity for people that you know and what you saw in austria for example a young black girl on the podium for the first time in 70 years that created um that created an awareness young particularly young black girls and girls in general i think saw that that's an actual real possibility to go into becoming an engineer and sparking those kind of um you know those those kind of reactions and and and actually having company for example mercedes is now partnering with um some of the schools in london and creating you know just as so that they're putting attention elsewhere creating a bigger pool and a bigger opportunity for people to get into those stem subjects that perhaps weren't previously done and what i'm i'm not aware of is any other team firstly doing that i'm not aware of any other team acknowledging that is even an issue and those are things that i feel that um need to change this year and it goes back to that accountability we can all do more a lot of these brands that we work with are um sell cars to people from all different backgrounds and make their money from people from from the outside world i feel like from inside it needs to reflect the outside world ,1,Lewis
um really don't know i think um the ferraris obviously were previously uh strong if they can get their engine right i heard they have essentially have a new engine maybe things will turn around for them um so yeah i don't particularly have an opinion on either i think it's great that they both have i think strong positions and um be interesting to see how how they perform in terms of consistency and deliverables through the year,1,Lewis
have to ask him that question i'd i'm not there yet so i don't know what problems comes when you get to 38. isn't he 30 isn't he 40. 39 yeah i'm sure he's fine,1,Lewis
um i think it's the kind of the shut off at the end of the year kind of um taking time away from myself um it wasn't the easiest of breaks i think it's also you know i continue to be kind of conscious of what's happening in the world and you know posting pictures and celebrating of things such as a contract being signed is kind of not really important to me and i don't really that's not really a message that i want to be sending out to people who are losing families who are losing relatives still to you know who are struggling and pandemic you know that's just not just kind of just not where i'm at so i just kind of kept to myself i was focused on on my my recovery because it wasn't um a quick a quick situation and and getting myself back to um you know full strength and getting the deal done and um and working on some personal relationships that i have um so yeah,1,Lewis
I thought it was a good move um I broke late and uh left left plenty of space and uh you know we got through and um I knew I had to to do that to try and give myself the best chance to win the race so for me it was good,1,Piastri
not really I mean we uh yeah we we thought from pretty early on it was a two stop um you know I knew that that Lando had pitted onto a two stop obviously and it just felt very risky to try and go for a one at that point my left front tire was was very grained and I had still to do 15 more laps so um yeah obviously in hindsight staying out would have been the right thing but you know I think in Charles's position if the One Stop didn't work for him he would have finished third and if he did a two stop he would have finished third so why not try something a bit different in case it works and uh yeah when you're leading the race it's um yeah a tough decision to make,1,Piastri
um yeah I mean I was uh I think the pace was about what I expected it was just that I was hoping he was going to fall off a bit um I think he kind of went through the same kind of graining and then it it seemed to clear up for him which I didn't expect uh you know in in all of practice and even on the medium as soon as the the front tyre started to grain it was basically game over um so yeah I was a bit surprised that it did kind of came back to him and he could maintain that pace um yeah just obviously in hindsight it's it's uh a great thing to know but um at the time I think what we did was a sensible strategy,1,Piastri
I don't think so I mean we we're both racing drivers we're you know we still got eight more races left and I gave myself the best chance to win that race and uh you know race wins don't come around very often we got three between us so um you know it's it's always a difficult decision of course um but yeah you know we of course are a bit disappointed I guess that we're not first second and we're second and third but uh yeah for me it was a sensible strategy just yeah you know I think those are kind of Championship winning days obviously not race winning days but uh yeah uh you know I think there was probably a more than 50/50 chance that that goes wrong and uh you know you can kick yourself at the end of the day of a long Championship with with if that kind of thing goes wrong obviously now it hurts um but if it had have gone wrong and we had have lost the champion the constructors by that amount of points you know I think we would have felt pretty pretty terrible at the end,1,Piastri
yeah I mean I tried at the start of the race to to get in front but um once I dropped out of DRS I I just didn't have the pace and uh after the after the stop I I saw we were pretty close again and um I felt like we had a little bit of extra grip and and I had to go for it because I knew that if I didn't get past I was uh didn't get past at the start of the S I was never going to get past so um went for a a pretty big lunge but um managed to to pull it up and then hung on for de life for the next 35 laps so um yeah the the last couple of laps once he dropped out of DRS were a little bit more relaxing but there's no such thing as a relaxing lap around here so it was uh it was hard work but no I think that definitely goes down as one of my one of my better races in my career,1,Piastri
yeah I think considering where we started when I joined the team last year um you know we were literally last and uh now we are leading the world championship so it's a full credit to the team for the the turnaround we've managed to have in my 18 months here um you know first in terms of improving the car but helping me improve as well um you know results like this definitely weren't possible 12 months ago for myself so um it's a a massive team effort and um yeah excited to see what the the future holds,1,Piastri
uh not well not into like into link but 81 was the number I had when I raced carts in Australia so uh whenever I've had a free choice cuz in like the junior categories you don't really get a choice whenever I had a free choice I always shows 81 so it went through F1,1,Piastri
uh I mean I I was a very compe I mean still am a competitive person but I was a very competitive kid in everything basically so uh before I kind of got into cars and racing uh I mean I just like playing all kinds of sports but even at school like with my school work I was very competitive in trying to get it right and also doing it as as quickly as I could uh so I always wanted to be the first one finished um so I was just always very competitive growing up and then that naturally translated to cars and racing uh when I got involved in that but yeah I think that competitiveness is something I was born with. I don't know how uh how successful you're going to be if you're not very competitive,1,Piastri
uh I I would say yes mostly um it like I think my personality is pretty relaxed and calm as it is I mean there's been conscious effort on that as well uh I mean not in terms of uh curing a personality but in terms of uh making sure I'm in their right head space when I'm in the car um so I think you know maybe it came a bit more naturally than it does for for some others um but it was was still a conscious effort to to try and make sure I'm always in that head space uh because there are Still Moments you know most SP can be pretty frustrating at the best of times so uh it's yeah I would say combination of just how I kind of am naturally and then uh also having a conscious effort to to keep it that way and um yeah just be a professional really,1,Piastri
uh I mean to be honest I think in terms of uh like you know I knew when I when I know obviously I'm from Australia so I had to go to Europe to to race in all these categories and and try and become an F1 driver so I think that first initial leap comes with a pretty big responsibility with it kind of you know like you know you're leaving a family and Australia friends I lived with my dad for about 6 months and then went to boarding school in the UK so you learn to to grow up pretty quickly um but also I think for me it never I guess maybe in some ways it was Blissful ignorance uh of of the situation I was in but I always kind of knew that you know my first goal in racing was to become a professional I of course would have loved to have been in F1 uh as my first choice but at the end of the day I just wanted to have my job be a race car driver and that was that was good enough for me but of course I wanted to set my aims as high as I could so uh going to Europe and and kind of chasing the Dream of F1 was was very cool you know ,1,Piastri
you're racing against the best of the best and for me that's what I I really enjoy eny and enjoyed at the time about racing you know I was proving myself against the best kids in the world and you know it's it's a pretty surreal position to be in when you're you're at that level so that was was what I really enjoyed and I kind of knew that you know if if it didn't work out for me in Europe then then I had the opportunity to go and and try and race back in Australia yeah of course there was no success guarantee that I was going to succeed in that but um yeah I kind of aimed for F1 and if I didn't make it then I would have been disappointed but I knew I had potentially other options so I think having that perspective on things was a help uh and also just you know being realistic about my chances of F1 it's like you said there's a lot of drivers that don't get the opportunity or don't make it to F1 so uh you know I knew that it was going to be um a very good opportunity if I got to F1 rather than uh let's say a given or or something I missed,1,Piastri
I was yeah not not in the greatest of moods obviously um but yeah I think we kind of knew going into the year it was going to be uh a bit more difficult than we we would have liked um so I think the expectations were set pretty early on you know Notting our hopes too high um so I kind of knew what to expect but also at the same time you know I knew regardless of where the car was I had a hell of a lot to learn and and improve and develop um so I was not that concerned at that point of time where the car was I just wanted to make sure that you know I was doing a good enough job to kind of cement my future in in F1 because I me it's one thing getting an opportunity F1 it's another thing maintaining it and making a career out of it so that was kind of my first thing that I wanted to to do uh of course I would have loved the car to have been a bit quicker from the start but um at that point in in time I just wanted to try and prove myself and drive and you know I was enjoying just being in F1 I had a year out the year before got to watch everyone else race uh so it was just nice to be back in a race car doing doing what I love so,1,Piastri
I'm not sure I would ever say it was a good car um but I mean in some ways it it took a little bit of pressure off me and maybe put more pressure on the team but I I think there was always going to be comparisons to Lando when I when I jumped in uh you know I think with um with you know the results I had in my junior career with my entrance into F1 there was a lot of expectations uh on that so I think regardless of whether the car was basically last where it was or whether it was one of the quickest I was always going to be compared um and you know almost when you're in that position people are expecting you know a kind of standout result where you finish out of position in some ways so I don't think it lowered the pressure that much just because those comparisons were always going to be there,1,Piastri
uh I mean I think the big thing for me was that you know I felt really uh wanted and appreciated by the team I guess you know it was it was you know I think we all know it wasn't a straightforward entry for me into F1 and uh McLaren really showed a lot of a lot of trust a lot of faith in me uh and and ultimately gave me my my chance in F1 so I think that sense of of being wanted and desired to be in the team that was a massive help uh you know the team at that point in time were were a solid Midfield team and uh with a lot of history of course which is is always nice to um you know to race for a team with so much history like McLaren but I think for me really that sense of being wanted was a massive draw card um you know and I think I I thought the team had potential I admittedly probably not as as much potential as we've shown in the last 18 months I thought maybe we'd get there one day I thought maybe we'd get there one day but I didn't expect that day to be a year and a half in so um yeah just that sense of of being wanted and uh yeah being being off with the opportunity was really what what draw me to Mclaren,1,Piastri
I mean I think you know I never really like putting it down to to one person and I know the person that I'm going to mention doesn't like it either but I think Andrea Stella has been a massive you know a massive benefit to to this team obviously has been here for for a while but I think him as a leader,1,Piastri
in the team principal role has been uh you know nothing short of incredible um I know he doesn't like to take the credit for it uh that much but it's it's true he's been an incredible leader and you know a lot of this success wouldn't have been possible without his leadership I'm not saying that he redid everything himself but you need you need a leader you need someone to guide you through through the tough times and Andrea was was fantastic at that so um yeah I think he's been incredible I think Zach as well has always been very very energetic uh and very enthusiastic and wanting to get through the tough times but yeah I would put you know a lot of the success down to Andrea in in his leadership uh I think in terms of myself on Lando I think we've always from day one had very similar feedback about the car and what we want from the car which I think is always helpful for the team when they can go in in basically one direction yeah ,1,Piastri
but also I think we've been pushing each other as well you know I think for me it was was obvious Lando was going to be a strong Benchmark coming into F1 uh and you know I like to think that that hopefully we've been able to boost each other a bit you know I think he's definitely taught me a lot of things in F1 and hopefully I've taught him a couple of things in our pretty short time together so far so um I think you know from the technical side of view side of things we've been helpful for the team but I think also for each other we've pushed each other to to a you know a higher level as well which is ultimate what you want as team,1,Piastri
uh yeah he would have been he would have been pretty happy he would have been very happy I think first he wouldn't have believed it that it was him but he would have been incredibly happy uh I don't think he probably would have gone through like the the pride and the emotions of it but he probably would have been like hell yeah this won my first F1 race uh and I mean that's kind of like how I was a bit as well even crossing the line uh maybe a bit more a sense of relief uh but um no it was it was very very cool and I think you know young me uh probably would have said you were dreaming uh if if you know if I told him that so uh that was was cool ,1,Piastri
yeah I mean it was obviously a uh a very intricate situation you know it's the first time I know McLaren had a onew a few years ago in Monza but it's been a long time since we've had a onew purely on on Merit um and uh you I think the team got got some flak for you know what was a cautious decision um but ultimately we wanted to protect a one two at the end of the day uh and you know I think it's the the trust that they have in Lando and I that they uh you know swapped us around like that knowing that it would would be swapped back yeah of course when you're fighting for first and second and you get I guess put into the lead of a race it's it's a very difficult situation because you know doesn't doesn't come around every day um but you know I think it's that underlying trust with us all that mean that that things like this are possible you know I think decisions like that and and communication like that I don't think is possible at every at every team so um yeah I mean yes we got a bit of clack for it and it was a new experience for us you know we've not been in that position before yeah um but I think we handled it very well in terms of trying to secure a one two uh and I think we did what was was very fair,1,Piastri
uh not that much I mean we see a lot of each other at the race probably like no more yeah um we need to we need to have some paddle games um yeah I I've just recently got myself a car in Monaco so I can actually drive to paddle now,1,Piastri
I am okay I can hold my own against some other drivers on can you play golf I can't play golf okay a massive golf golf fan and golf player so um we see each other enough I think uh but we do need to have some paddle games that's absolutely,1,Piastri
uh I don't really know what I thought it would be to be honest um I would say certain parts of it definitely are you you know I get to drive the fastest cars in the world as my job um so that part's definitely as it says on the T pretty damn cool um I think the you know the other stuff around it like the the pressure and you know the talk and I mean the the noise around it is I guess in some ways expected you know you don't appreciate it really when you're going up uh because you're not exposed to that but I think as I've gotten older you know it's the same in every sport and every walk of life really when you're at the top of whatever you do there's always going to be pressure and and people with opinions um I think the the thing that's been the let's say the weirdest to get used to is like just people recognizing you like I think people recognizing you at the track that's that's that's one thing and like that's kind of a given but uh like people recognizing you in the street and like at dinner and stuff like that that like that takes you can't really train for that kind of stuff ,1,Piastri
like you can kind of train you know obviously physically train and whatever for racing but you can kind of get media training or you know be exposed to that I mean I still kind of kind of find a weird calling Fame but uh like but like with that no one can like teach you or train you how to be famous y uh so and you know of course the fans are a massive part of our Sport and uh and you know the reason our sport exists basically um so of course you don't want to disappoint them or anything but you do kind of have to draw a line at some point and and maintain your private life so I think that's probably been the biggest thing to get used to but I wouldn't say it's like necessarily bad like you have the odd person here or there who pushes the limits but I think a lot of people are very very respectful of that um so yeah I would say it is pretty much all as it as it uh ,1,Piastri
uh very good question I mean I'm still kind of fighting my feet with with outside of F1 obviously like for me I started racing because I loved it and it was a hobby and like that's what I was passionate about and still am and I think obviously at this point of my career I'm still learning a hell of a lot improving a lot and like just trying to be the best I can and now that we have have a race wining car I'm very uh zoned in on that I mean I like good food I'm okay when I can be bothered I'm I'm okay uh I can I can cook a pretty good honey soy Salmon I can I can cook a few things I'm not too bad okay um so I mean I kind of like that like again depends very much on the mood like if I could be bothered and especially if I'm cooking if I'm cooking for myself then it's kind of painful because yeah fine you'd spend like I made a risoto once o hello took me like an hour to cook the damn thing yeah I ate it all in five minutes I ate it all in 5 minutes had a million things to wash up I was like well it was nice but not nice enough to do it again uh it's like if you got other people then like you know you don't waste as much food you can cook for them and it's it's nice so I will go with that at the moment ,1,Piastri
at the moment um I've been having I mean I like Poached Eggs so I've been having poached eggs on toast,1,Piastri
well he's not a big fan of fish in case no one's noticedand I used to get smoked salmon and he used to absolutely hate it yeah I mean I I don't have smoke salmon anymore because I feel like I've kind of overeaten it to the point where I don't like it anymore uh so I've gone I've gone to ham instead like well like it's basically bacon um so that's my go-to at the moment ,1,Piastri
well in F1 I kind of need to create a new one cuz winning a race was kind of at the top of it's a good problem to have uh I mean I guess to win more is in the bucket for that. outside of F1 uh I mean there's nothing immediately is coming to mind I mean just enjoy life for sure I think that's probably a good one to have um,1,Piastri
I I wouldn't do bungee jumping oh no but sky maybe more open to I've been offered once or twice and have to go up in like the fighter jets maybe I would do that but again I'm not in a rush to do that but that is on the bucket list at some point ,1,Piastri
I don't know like this kind of goes back to the the fame thing in social media I don't know what people don't know about me now I think a lot of people think I'm very calm which I think I am but that I have I still have my moments I still have you know you need the odd moment of rage here and there and like some people like think I'm like just complete Flatline but I do have do have my moments ,1,Piastri
yeah it was last year was a whirlwind and a lot changed through the year on and off track I guess you know on track it was I won two out of the first six races and it was like it could be uneven for a real title title fight this yes everything was like going let's say to plan yes accordingly and and then it just kind of quickly fell apart and it wasn't like I wouldn't say fell apart didn't fall apart but just struggled too I mean I didn't get another podium all year and that was like crazy and penalties and problems and this and that and I was just like it just felt like a real uphill battle and then I was like teams were starting to announce their driver lineups and everything and and I was just stunned I don't know I just felt like I was becoming a bit I mean it's obvious probably with some interviews I did and frustrations but at times I was just unhappy yeah and putting it simply unhappy because I just wanted more ,1,Ricciardo
it's a good question I'd be lying if I could tell you what movie I was watching I got to get the notebook yeah it's actually I I now look forward to long-haul flights for that reasoning that's actually a chance to call it 10 hours to switch off and to be alone and it's not often these days where you can actually have that and yes so that that gave me that last bit of I guess clarity I needed and I went back and forth all year you know from the side of the I mean the the initial the first red bull contract got put in front of me in in winner testing well absolutely spoke about imitating so that was like it was really all up until the summer July August that I was kind of going through my head scenarios and what I wanted and yeah it was that I guess that was that that final little moment,1,Ricciardo
Well it was further before I called anyone I wanted to make sure I was like no I had enough time I don't have time over the flight to figure it out so alum or dad was the first person and because I like he would never make a decision for me you know he's like my parents are just there to support him be good parents um but for sure like I could kind of sense in them as well that they felt I needed a change and they could see I was starting to let it beat me up a bit at times and so when I told Dad I was I was like I'm gonna move I'm gonna go to Renault and and he was I felt he like had a bit of a sigh of relief and it was like I really think you need this and I think of the race or a good thing you got yeah yeah ,1,Ricciardo
all right so firstly I and I'm sure he's probably not the only one to have that opinion so I can see how people might want to think that'll say that I know everyone's has an opinion and and that hasn't been pulled out of nowhere so like what it is what it is yep I obviously say no not true I love a good fight and I it was more about for this way it's about me than max and it was about me a lot of reasons but one one which I've stated a few times and I think some people will understand it but I was at Red Bull for five years I was at Red Bull and they'd won four world titles and I joined straight after that so in five years looking you know from that first year I might okay in five years yeah I'm gonna win a world title like that's it's gonna happen it didn't we never really got close yeah and I'm not like I'm up it's not saying that's it I'm not bitter about it it's just it's what happened that was the basic reality yeah and then it was now okay we're gonna try and rebuild a new chapter with with Honda and I just I saw there was more risks for me staying and that project failing again so to speak I mean their expectation is to win that's the time level of roosters there is you coming here yeah and I was just like my the ability for me to become more frustrated in this environment is I just saw it as and I just don't want to be that kind of unhappy yeah bitter person that's just like always are what could have been or if only I joined red ball in 2013 I sort of think so I was like I need to move on so it wasn't about max I understand how somebody might think that,1,Ricciardo
I mean we'll see we I'm also very aware we got like work ahead of us but I don't expect this transition to be easy yep I knew wouldn't be easy answering these questions I knew it wouldn't be easy trying to build this team to the next step but I'm like really motivated for that challenge and that's I don't know there was just something in it which really I guess inspired me and I was just attracted to it yeah to something within this ,1,Ricciardo
yeah I guess he's pretty chilled like I actually haven't worked that much with him at the moment but initial impressions I'll say he's too old and that's for a few reasons the main ones probably that he's it's not his first rodeo he's been doing this longer than I have yeah he's been around the block so he's he's kind of like he knows how it works yeah and it's like he's got his way of doing things and that's that how it's gonna be and that way is just yeah like I'll get on with the job,1,Ricciardo
yes yeah everyone so the chief engineer Chiron he actually he used to be at Red Bulls from my very first test at Red Bull he was an engineer because that was Mark Webber's engineers like his crew for that test and so he engineered me like my first proper everyone tests so he sir he oversees a whole engineering department so I don't work one-on-one but he's yeah I can definitely I've worked with him before so he's the main guy I could relate to from that otherwise everyone else is pretty much knew there's a couple f3 mechanics brought that I used to be on my team at college,1,Ricciardo
I want to win yesterday so yeah to know that I'm not even gonna win tomorrow so to speak is not easy but I definitely feel this is it was the best place that I had looking for my future if that makes sense and I believe we will win last I wasn't I'm likely gonna be in Melbourne yeah it's not gonna be that soon because the gap to the top 3 is big and you can build a new car in 3-4 months and do good work but that's now that next issue,1,Ricciardo
I think I just stand at the front of the grid and each car I walk past hopefully it's not too many but each car walk past who's in front of me I just step on their front wing I don't think there's a written rule we're like well we could we could probably test that Wow I don't know I'll take a question max yeah right yeah so rule changes are 29 zero qualifier then I'll make a decision yeah so every year there's real changes for whatever reason but this year the idea is to make the racing closer the wings my kind of stuff,1,Ricciardo
yeah yes so I think forgive me if I'm gonna speak completely out of here just sound like an idiot but the wake that comes off the front wings I think it then disturbs the car behind it's it's all messed up air and so I believe I don't even know how I'm saying myself but it should become more simple that the air is less disturbed so the car that follows has less of a negative in fact somewhat sounds good,1,Ricciardo
I think that's a big one is so that I don't know how again maybe this front wing is the solution if it's a more exaggerated version of that you know down the line but yeah that that's the main thing is I mean we can be quicker than the kind front and we'll catch them but then it's like as soon as you get quite close you lose that speed advantage you had and then you get stuck in there dirty air as we call it then your tires overheat so there's a few things I think the tires could be better in those conditions so I don't know if that's through thermal we've talked about a bit but again that's for the tire guys to figure out but so that's probably something with the way that the tires respond yeah but also yeah it's so following a car is is a big one DRS has been good for everyone building that definitely has allowed you to if not overtake get closer send it exactly adding the cars of Awesome now that they're like wide and big the downside is the tracks haven't got wider or bigger so it does mean there's less room on the track to overtake and I know it's not much but it is making a bit of a difference ,1,Ricciardo
I think definitely - I don't have a position in my head you know and the fact is until I'm first I'm probably never going to be satisfied so I haven't like set a position I want to make inroads on those top three big three teams so whether that means we've caught them by half a second or whether we I don't even expect to get into that top three this year I'd love to but I know as I said that gap is quite big now so if we just make inroads I'll be satisfied and I want to feel like I've had a positive influence on this team yeah that I would be I'd be very happy with that because that leads on into 2020 yeah exactly and I want them to feel like I obviously want to feel like it was the right decision for me but I want them to feel like they're let's say investment in me into the team yeah he's been worth while and he's really had a positive influence and he's driven the team you know to that next level,1,Ricciardo
so it's more it's probably more the comfort and controls that feels more different than the actual hand long-hair and characteristics because like comparing it to the Red Bull what the car is doing like you always want more grip like there's no car that's perfect and you always want a bit more grip at the rear that's kind of just how it works so I feel like I'm asking for the same things okay maybe the Red Bull I can just come off the brakes a bit earlier and carry a bit more speed whatever but it's not handling completely different but it's more my seating position the steering wheel just even I don't know like it's mainly the switches but maybe the steering wheel is a little bit higher a  little bit lower and that feels more weird different then the way the car is actually balanced on the track and you know you can't really tell you getting the seam either not really but you get used to it you know I remember the first day last week testing I was like our pedals feel too far away steering wheel feels too high headrest isn't quite right they're like oh by the end of this block by the end of the week though they're like alright so we're going to change you so this is this next week we can get these new parts for you because at all maybe that's right now okay we'll still change out but you just get used to so it's it's all good ,1,Ricciardo
I think that's it's gonna be very much up to probably my level of success in the sport in terms of if I can be competitive I I'm don't wanna speak for Luis but I think if he hadn't had a low championship winning car the last few years he may have said goodbye a couple years ago so it's the drive I'm winning is a bigger part of anything yeah yeah if I'm winning or again making progress and getting closer and having a sniff then I'll keep I'll keep going,1,Ricciardo
man early like earlier a few years ago what I said yes but at this stage I'm thinking about it less like I'm like I feel if I put everything into f1 by the end of it I'll probably be quite burnt out and done with race cars so I would I would confidently say that I would at least take some time off yeah after f1 like I wouldn't jump into another category straightaway yeah otherwise I might as well just stay in f1 like it's the pinnacle so yeah ideally I take all my boxes here and then say see you catch you later yeah something else,1,Ricciardo
that's a thing I know like and I would love to again yeah it's we'll see we'll see the more years I do of this I still love it but it is it is tiring and I feel like every year gets busier and busier whether it's on or off track so again if I do it right and tick all the boxes and create something for myself as well outside of racing then I hopefully won't feel the need to keep racing you know at 40 years old,1,Ricciardo
oh you can't say that okay oh wow a song that is very close to me for a long time from a young age was mr. Tambourine Man by Bob Dylan so it's it's kind of nostalgic I was dad used to have that album in his car and my when I was a kid I'll spend the weekends with him whether he's at work or whatever and you know you just be kind of on repeat yep and I remember I just used to be able to sing every word of that song so that reminds me of just like the early days and just being with dad and just like before before things got complicated,1,Ricciardo
oh one tree hill one tree hill other day well that that was a big like so when I moved to Europe that was like I was obsessed with that mm-hmm and at the time I was I guess I was young whatever but I remember like I was quiet I could relate to a lot of things weirdly about that show in terms of a lot of their like they used to have like these real quiet little quotes and it was what's the word I don't know anyway One Tree Hill and I kind of always had a crush on Cynthia Bush and then Breaking Bad's hard to be beat,1,Ricciardo
pretty good early signs are good it's always yeah it's early like it's hard to really say and I probably said similar things last year I can't remember that up until you go racing you never know but look my day one in Barcelona was solid we racked up over a hundred laps so from reliability was good we'll all right well quickest but it's the times are whatever,1,Ricciardo
I think what I feel in the car yeah I mean obviously a big talking points a halo but you actually don't once you're in you don't really see it sailors that sounds like cuz it's in front but you kind of pitch to yourself if you look at something in front of you yeah you see it but if you kind of look like if I'm looking at you now yeah I don't really notice it's there so it's a bit like that so it's fine I know it looks ugly but it's whatever it's cool ,1,Ricciardo
well I think it will be alright like I thought would have problems with the start lights but um we did some practice starts on the grid they let us do them you know in practice in testing at the end of the session and yeah the the top structure of the halo is quite a lot higher than I think we thought so the lights sit easily inside it and I think it's a bit the same like if we get to Austin turn one I don't think it's actually gonna sit as long as we feel so I think we'll be fine,1,Ricciardo
not really no Maria well I just I know there's smarter and a lot more people but that's their job to do and I mean sure like if I saw something weird or whatever I'll question it but there's literally tens of people if not more in the team justlooking at all little things and studying the other cars as well and they're all not only are they studying but they're also analyzing like okay like that's that's pretty much their wing from last year so we know that's not their real race wing so they're they kind of not shown their cards yet and so there's already all that going on it's quite fun but I don't really,1,Ricciardo
they could be like time will tell I think there again I'm guessing I'm sure didn't drive the car I don't know but I think their chassis wasn't bad I would say if I was to if I had to say I would that ours was better at the end of last year so I do a certain thing this chassis was say as good as ours but sure if they had maybe the Renault in they would have you know being closer up so I think if they've improved their chassis from last year and now with the Renault they they could be hunting for some top fives I'm not sure if they're a podium car yet but they could be getting closer,1,Ricciardo
I mean look the obvious ones I mean why I'm here is the world champion but without stating the obvious which is very obvious I want to be in the fight you know I want to be there at the end like I've had you know 2014 was a breakthrough year 16 was a good one there was some highs last year but even in the really real Goodyear's I've never been in the championship hunt you know I've won races and done good things but we've never been in the fight so I just want a car that's capable of taking me to that fight and then leave it with me and I'll take care of the rest,1,Ricciardo
yeah and the more the merrier like sure it's more intense and it'd be nice to have it wrapped up three races to go but yeah just to be in that fight and if you know the likes of McLaren are in that fight as well honestly the more the merrier I think having that and having having also other drivers that could take points away from you know others and yeah that would be cool so come over,1,Ricciardo
yeah I think the first impressions certainly were good and I don't think you know if you've got a race winning car on the first day but you know if you've got a bit of a dog and I know I don't have a dog so that's that's good and yeah you know like it was doing some some good things like the rear is powerful in the f1 you know obviously the rear-wheel drive but a lot of the downforce and that is produced in the rear and a lot of your grip and lap time comes from that and first impressions is we had a pretty good real you know who get on the throttle quite hard and aggressive so yeah the signs are there that we got a decent vehicle,1,Ricciardo
yeah I think just it's not so much I mean obviously keep keep the good things you know obviously keep the intensity on race day and and keep kind of taking that yeah let's say the honey badger approach I mean that's been working for me the last few years for sure and the intensity is what I love so you know keep all that just clean up some little things and I never want to get complacent you know and it can you can find yourself I mean I've been with a team a few years now and I know everyone and in a way it can be easy just to walk into work every day and yeah yep all right let's go let's do it and I think I've always been pretty relaxed about my approach but I don't want the relax to turn into complacent so just make sure I'm staying ahead of the curve and you know what worked three months ago might not work today so just try and keep kind of evolving and just do my homework and make sure I'm staying ahead,1,Ricciardo
I mean ultimately the championship like if I was to win and Hills to get second but he had qualified me I couldn't care I mean well I lie there'd be a small part of me that cared but very small part if I'd won the title but yeah I mean it's look I think it's in our nature like we're competitors and you kind of never satisfied until you're perfect and I don't think we'll probably ever be perfect but you know getting up on the qualifying head-to-head and on the races is is ideal as opposed to just one or the other so yeah I'll make sure I'm taking both boxes I'll sleep better ,1,Ricciardo
yeah absolutely that's that's the biggest thing for me right now I mean if if I can be you know in a winning car then that's like the first kind of that's my first objective yeah so everyone's like oh you're gonna stay at Red Bull or what are you gonna do and I kind of says in a way it's pretty simple like if we go out and win the World title this year then I'm not leaving Red Bull so the performance long story short the performance will dictate I think at least my preference will I get my wish or wear it whatever I end up doing I don't know but um yeah,1,Ricciardo
I think once you start racing obviously you get an idea but then you know that even once you do Melbourne and probably the first couple races it's still quite fresh and you still kind of bring in new parts on the car so yeah I mean I would say you want to get a few handful of races in so probably once the real European season starts like mid May around then you get an idea yeah when you come back here so but also you want to you want to talk contracts and that after a good race so everyone only remembers the last race so whichever one I can try and win then I'll get on the phone straightaway but no I haven't said it I'm like honestly I've I've answered a lot of contract questions already and I'm trying to answer them differently because I just don't want to sound boring but I really don't have a real answer ,1,Ricciardo
good question it varies I guess I mean all definitely a lot of the time I'm actually in the simulator straight after the race on the Monday or the Tuesday so during the simulator session we'll put some time aside to analyze the weekend as well so yeah we do we do some of it directly after the race we have the engineering meeting like the race summary and the weekend summary so that we kind of spend probably 90 minutes on the Sunday evening already kind of analyzing it and then maybe at the Monday all the choose and the sim if I'm not in the serum if I'm at home yeah I'll most likely watch like a race replay and then I've got like a lot of data at my disposal and sector times and this and that which I can pick apart so yeah it it depends I mean some weekends I'll honestly know what I did right what I didn't and it's kind of so clear in my mind that I don't feel I need to spend that much time,1,Ricciardo
yeah I would let's say nine times out of ten I would watch the race to see if I could pick up something and even yeah like obviously normally our competitors are the frontrunners you know see we're running towards the front but you don't want to look over look some things that happen in the midfield as well because there may be a driver or a team tried a good strategy so and it's good to then question the team my team what they thought of that so yeah but I guess I don't really have a set structure up until now you know I'm like okay Monday 9:00 a.m. I watch the race and then I analyze it but I will do some form of that ,1,Ricciardo
I mean the racing stuff no you know in terms of what we're doing in the car but I think they did some cool things like the f1 paddock you know like the as they call it you know the pits in a way it's very a lot of the time you're connected to a team like you can really only enter the paddock if you're if you've got a pass from a team so then you know for my friends or if we got guests you know they're normally at red ball the whole time and that's where they are and then guess a Ferrari are there so I think at times you could find this probably a lot of cool people within the paddock but they're all kind of separated in a way so they've tried to you know they put like a bit of a bar a bit of a social area in the paddock they've tried to get some music and some a bit more of a um common yeah common space is that the word communal also yeah so where people can kind of mingle and actually interact and just to create a bit more energy in the in the pits and in the paddock because it's uh yeah I went to like a MotoGP paddock a few years ago and it was chaotic probably too much that way but there was certainly some energy in there which I think Liberty's trying to enhance which which is cool,1,Ricciardo
there's already formally there's already formally and you know had softer formally I think they've done quite well you know in the fuse they've had and and they're doing all right but I think that's that and F ones this and yeah look I what I remember is a kid like the first thing you think about with f1 even I think before you think about the speed is the noise yeah and the noise creates the speed so I watched an on board a few days ago I saw a now on YouTube I think it was maybe a v10 so an on board of an f1 and I turned the noise off and I watched and I was like he's actually going pretty slow like I care about what track it was but I was picturing myself now and as like our cars now are a lot quicker yeah but I turned the volume on and I was like it just sounds fast and it looks faster because of the sound so we need the sound to create the atmosphere so,1,Ricciardo
great question I was a I got driven in a Tesla once so yeah I've been in one but I haven't driven it myself pretty it not feeling the acceleration but it's a yes he's not everything they're impressive don't don't get me wrong they are super impressive and yeah unless unless we go full electric we put some sweet subwoofers out the back blast and some v10 noises I don't know but to go silent I just think it would certainly lack like the atmosphere and I don't I really feel you'd see quick drop in numbers in fans because that's part of the experience totally,1,Ricciardo
I'm so torn because like I am yeah it's hard because I'm a race car driver talking about China yeah make things better but yeah some things look we will always be is it worth nostalgic like things that we remember from the past so but yeah Commodore is a v8,1,Ricciardo
I try and keep up sure I yeah I mean I got some friends at race and I think the racing is good so if I can catch some replays or something yeah I still what like enjoy watching racing even if I don't read a whole lot I still enjoy watching it for sure but yeah it's hard to keep up but I do I do try and keep up with like supercars and NASCAR with the Supercross yeah there's a few Motorsports,1,Ricciardo
yeah it can be some people haven't got on well with it as far as the naught Knorr egos so yeah it's it's pretty intense look if I'm I'll put it simple terms I'll try and create a percentage so f1 car that's 100% you go drive it that's the real thing our sim I would put somewhere around 85% Wow and I would put you know like a playstation kind of sim it may be 2015 15 20 % so it's pretty impressive from that from that scope,1,Ricciardo
yeah it blows my mind like I yeah I mean that's really what we use the sim for like it's cool for learning new tracks and whatever but it's really for the team to develop the car and yeah try things and if it looks good all right they'll call up the workshop makes dowon's they boys build that so but yeah it's it's impressive it's it's in a big dark room and yeah it's like in kind of in a cinema like in a theatre and yeah I can't describe too much about it but I mean you're sitting in a full-size pretty much cockpit and yeah you've got yeah you've got like all your it's not just a screen in front of you you've got vision everywhere and it feels pretty real and the graphics the graphics are pretty amazing ,1,Ricciardo
I don't think I get stitched up too much but I don't know maybe my wife's too stingy operator um it's fun yeah like I couldn't tell you what though but I just like I just like being a bit of an idiot and having some fun but but I'm also I'm also careful with like if I was to do a prank I know that it's going to be returned so I'm never going to deliver something which I can't take myself so yeah but I just I just enjoy being a bit of a bit of a clown I guess,1,Ricciardo
I could definitely spend spend time there you know I think for me firstly home will always be home like Oz's else to me and I love getting back to us you know especially Christmastime when it's summer in that it's I struggled leaving this year yeah well I mean where I'm like leaving in peak season you know it's summer it's awesome and I'm going back to like the cold winter and it's tough because like you go from a massive high and for me like I do struggle with a cold like February is definitely my toughest month of the year as far as my personal happiness so I go from like December January which is awesome to that so it's uh yeah I just I definitely love home and I'm certainly connected to it and obviously my friends and family there and I think with the states what I found you know particularly California is there's a lot of similarities to home but it's also it's something still new for me and it's also a real escape because I do go home and I mean obviously I my name is a lot bigger in Australia than it is in America for starters but even just family alone like it is hard to get some real quiet time so the states is a good place yeah yeah exactly and and just it's not a bad thing but you just have to be a bit selective where you go as well if you don't want you know let's say attention and sometimes you might one of their yeah yeah funnily enough I don't really crave the attention people might say I'm full of crap because I do silly videos or whatever all the time but I could happily go under the radar all the time but yeah the states is it's kind of home it's got everything home really has but without the the extra I don't know it's not f1 you know no one cares about f1 at the moment in California for example so yeah I can just do my thing and really feel I'm away from it when I need a switch off,1,Ricciardo
percentage it's hard like no time I'll say look I'll say like I don't call it 5050 50 but what I'm 100% sure of is no driver will hop in whatever year it is the back running car so I feel bad if I say a team but the dad disrespect I'll call it back up and running carbon whatever the Sal burr of last year for example wasn't that fast it's you know you don't have to be Einstein but Louis okay I'll use Louis's things out we won the World title yeah but he's not gonna he's get the same bathroom in victory lane you know so the machine is still super important but I mean the cars don't have like there's no electronics so there's no attraction control is no nothing so the driver is doing all the driving 100% yeah and you definitely still separate I still feel like the top will rise and whether you you're in a small team you'll find your way into a big team and get you get your shot but call it 5050,1,Ricciardo
it's funny I am no no it's so no one taught me and I don't know if I should be proud or not but thanks rusty I I think I did it yeah last year in Austin no so 2016 in Austin yeah I didn't plan it nothing I just got asked something and I think I've done a whole day of media and I was kind of just a bit over it by that stage so I just thought I'm just gonna speak American and I kind of liked it so every now and then I'll throw in some everyone says it sounds like Forrest Gump so I don't know but I just kind of taught myself so I did if that's how you to be proud of and so be it well done Daniel well done,1,Ricciardo
I guess it's food right or not chocolate or yeah it's a lame it's a ice cream yeah alright let's go let's get creative the last probably the last two years I've really discovered fried chicken burgers Wow yeah and man like if I'm going for a cheat day and I want savory pleasure like filthy filthy fried but when I say filthy like not take away yeah like from a decent restaurant but dirty greasy soggy mmm fried chicken burger yeah,1,Ricciardo
Dumb and Dumber that's absolutely up they're like hands down I'll say one more I like using this one because it's left a field and I've never heard anyone say it Friday Night Lights Billy Bob Thornton American footballing I really like the soundtrack and it was just it was filmed a little bit differently the movie I'm not a director I don't I don't know yeah the cinematography was done kind of different it kind of followed a few characters and it was interesting I just watching it and because it wasn't the happy ending either yeah but it still was powerful so I like that,1,Ricciardo
all right so there's been a breakthrough in my life okay I I reckon less than a month ago I probably three weeks ago I signed up to Spotify yeah so I'm I've now got music on my phone but I I know but I still miss I mean I got my iPod yeah and I still want to run it as as much as I can but actually Spotify has been good I use SoundCloud as well I like SoundCloud for like the under yeah exactly I like discovering new stuff and then tell them people about it but just telling cool people,1,Ricciardo
actually Perth boy Sam Worthington Sam Worthington yeah avatar Sam Worthington that's his name why doesn't that sound right yeah I watched Unabomber manhunt it's really good yeah it wasn't long but really good so I did that and the sinner Jessica Biel she's cute yeah,1,Ricciardo
Ferrari 250 short wheelbase so that's an old car it's worth in excess of 10 million now so it's a serious car modern car go with the Aston Martin Valkyrie and yelled go an Aussie muscle car in there throw an Aussie muscle car in there you choose for me so that'd be a good that's very diverse so yeah got a bit of everything,1,Ricciardo
who would play me it depends if we're going like serious or not if we're going not serious probably mmm I don't know about now at least back then probably Adam Sandler otherwise Chris Hemsworth did well in all of our what's it called rush yeah right yeah that's right yeah I don't know if he's as good-looking as me though but uh he melds women's hearts doesn't yell Chris I met him in Monaco good guy how would it end you know what I'm gonna get deep here and I'm gonna say not with a stereotypical ending of me holding a world championship trophy I would want it to end beyond that because I would like to think that that wasn't all I achieved in life if that makes sense I sort of just thought I'd go a bit,1,Ricciardo
"I think many things. First of all, formula One because it's the expression of high performance in motorsport, but I don't know, high performance, for me, it's maybe delivering higher than expectations and having that extra something on everything you do. And that probably for me means high performance",0,Alonso
"Well, I think we all try to give that little bit extra. As you said, it's something that we all try to achieve, but it's a little bit relative and especially in a sport, you have the comparation with your main competitors. So it's doing that little extra compared to them and finding the best version of yourself, which is an unlimited probably search because every day, there is something that you can learn and you can improve. So it is a difficult task, but it's something that you pursue in life and in sport as well. ",0,Alonso
"Not really, not really, because I think even if you are not in a professional sport, you will start pursuing something in your personal life or you will try to achieve different goals in different businesses or different things that you will may start in your life after your motorsport career. So I think it's a way of living in a way, but it's something that is not tiring. It's just pure motivation, I think to wake up every morning and do a little bit extra.",0,Alonso
"Yeah, my first race was at the age of three, which at the moment right now is just not legal anymore. I think the driver license for go-kart, they start at eight now. So that's good to don't have, you know, kids at three years old behind a wheel. But back then, my father was a go-kart driver, just driving around my region, never on a national level or not international for sure. And yeah, more for fun than anything else. Created a small go-kart handmade for my sister that is five years older than me so my sister was eight. My sister didn't like the go-kart on that first couple of days that my father tried. And then, yeah, eventually he put me in the go-kart and, you know, I like it. And yeah, as I said, I did my first race at the age of three. It was a street circuit. I don't remember anything of course, but I have the videos and the photos of that day. And I think the race was 15 laps and I did two of them. So I got lap at 13 times and in 15. (Damian laughs) But yeah, they told me that I won the race, so I was happy after all and yeah, that's how it started.",0,Alonso
"Not really. And I think the speed of that go-kart obviously was like a five or six kph. You could walk alongside the go-kart so it was not fast at all. and the risk maybe for my parents were not, it was not a risky thing to do. But yeah, I think it's something that especially families in motorsport, they have to deal with it. They have to have a different perception of risk because, you know, every time we jump on a racing car, you know, anything can happen. You know, now the cars are very safe. The circuits are very safe as well. We are in good hands with our teams. The FIA, everyone is trying to protect us. But yeah, anything can happen. So I think if I put in the shoes of my parents or anyone that is raising for sure, there is this risk factor that you have to know how to deal with it. ",0,Alonso
"Yeah, it is a very interesting question because I spoke many times with them, with my parents and with my family in general because they are not at all competitive. So I don't know how, you know, I can be that competitive in everything I do. They still remember when we were playing, you know, games at home or cards or anything at home, you know, I was so competitive and I was so upset with them. I could maybe not talk to them for full one day if I was not winning, all these kind of things. And they never understood why, you know, I was like that because no one in the family, you know, had this approach. So yeah, it's still unknown at the moment.",0,Alonso
"Well, I think it was more, for them, it was more a fun thing to do on the weekends. Obviously they had to work on the weekdays. My mother on a shopping mall, just selling perfumes and my father on a explosive company just doing explosive for the mines in my region. So the weekends was kind of fun weekend with other families. This motorsport enthusiasm with the kids driving go-karts,  but with no expectations at all that that could become one day a professional thing. So I don't know, always started like this. I won the Spanish championship in '94 and then one Italian mechanic saw me there in the Spanish championship and said, ""You have to come to Italy and race in European Championships and World Championships."" And my father answered, ""We can't afford to travel to Italy,"" and those kind of things. So they said, ""Okay, I will speak with the factory and they can help you."" So that is how I started.",0,Alonso
"From what I remember, it was like a Spanish championship, I think back in '97. I won the Karting World Championship in '96. And then I went to... And I stopped racing in Spain for a few years. So I went back in Spain for the Spanish championship in '97. And that was the first time that I felt the pressure of winning or the need of winning because, you know, everyone expected that if you won the World Championship, how you will not win the Spanish championship the following year. And we were not that fast that weekend and you know, I remember to be a little bit tense or nervous before that start, you know, because I had to win that day. Eventually I did. But probably is my first memory of, ""Okay, now I need to deliver. You know, everyone is expecting a result from me.",0,Alonso
"Well, it is something that is very individual for me. When I have this pressure or when I feel that I have to deliver high expectations, I try to calm myself. I normally have a lot of self-confidence. I think that's very important to have confidence on what you are doing, on what you are capable of. That releases a little bit of pressure and you are able to over deliver if you have that confidence on yourself. But then, I'm a very technical person as well so I want to know everything about what I'm doing. When I'm not in my environment or in my comfort place, I get more stress for sure. So one way to be calm before a race or whatever, is to know everything about the strategy, everything about the tires, hearing from the engineers, from the strategists, 2, 3, 4 times, what is the plan, you know? So that's my approach to the race to be confident on what we are doing. Then maybe it doesn't work, but it's not coming from myself or whatever that I'm in doubt. But I think this is a very individual thing, how we approach these moments.",0,Alonso
"Yeah, I think so. That could be a good way to to explain it, but probably not only motor racing. It's a way of living as well. So when I'm at home relaxing and you know, I made the plan for the day or I go to the gym or there is a tennis match or whatever,  I treat that tennis match like a Formula One Grand Prix. So I have to know everything about with who I will play. If he's too strong, maybe I skip that day at the tennis because I hate losing. If he's too weak, maybe, you know, I maybe do extra sport before because that tennis match will not require too much of, you know, activity from myself. And these kind of things, so every day is very well organized in my head.",0,Alonso
"Well, in advance, yes, I know and by now at 41 years old, I know my body. I know my head, I know everything that I need to perform on my job. So when it becomes a long trip or a busy week of events or marketing or whatever, I know that I will need extra days of rest. So I plan everything well in advance. And I try to also travel as efficient as possible with the calendar that we have now. So, you know, you learn from your mistakes in the past and your previous years and experiences. ",0,Alonso
"I mean many things. I don't know how to cook. I don't know how to play golf. I don't know, you know, there are many things that I see people around me that they do, and I try to avoid those things. I skip those things because I know that I'm not good at, and I don't want to compare myself against them because they are better. One day if I train or if one day I do a cooking course or whatever, then maybe I cook for someone else or something like that. So I'm just doing let's say what I know that I can do and on that specific thing, I don't have much self-doubt or I don't have many problems. It's true that you arrive to Formula One and you see... When I got to Formula One, Michael Schumacher was dominating the sport, but I never thought that I was slower than him in a way. Maybe it was just a kamikaze approach to Formula One and to my start of my career. But, you know, I never doubt of having the same car. Maybe I could challenge him one day. So that's how all my career went so far.",0,Alonso
"I don't know. As I said, even when I stopped Formula One in 2018,. I remember I have to try different things in Motorsport because my head was just telling me that I have to go a little bit out of my comfort zone in Formula One. I mean, for many years, I was a little bit tiring of traveling, tiring of, yeah, not having the possibility of win anymore. And the Indy 500, the 24 Hour Le Mans, the Dakar Rally, they were all the disciplines in motorsport that I thought they were appealing and in a way, self rewarding because I never considered myself a Formula one driver. I just considered myself a driver, you know, in any kind of motorsport. It's not just a specific Formula One driving style. So by attempting those, I felt that I had to learn a lot of things from the beginning. So I went to the Le Mans 24 hour and I had very experienced teammates alongside me, and I have to learn a lot from them, but not publicly. I have to learn, you know, just private between them and myself because everyone expected that a Formula One driver will be very fast in any other car but I was just not knowing all those techniques. Same with Dakar Rally. Imagine from Formula One to Saudi with a Dakar rally car. It cannot be more opposite driving styles with the left foot and in the brake all the time, all these kind of things. So I have to do a lot of tests. I have to learn a lot but never doubting that I could be as good as the best one in each of the disciplines. And that was just a test for me. But, you know, a test that it was rewarding and I was happy.",0,Alonso
"Because I was thinking that I could succeed, yes on those categories and because I think in motorsport, there were not precedence of those kind of challenges. Maybe in the past, in the sixties or the seventies, there were Formula One drivers that they were driving different cars and attempting Le Mans and things like that. But now in the modern motorsport, you develop certain skills from a very young age to drive in that specific discipline. So if you are here in Europe and you are interested in Formula One, you're starting go-karts and then Formula 4, Formula 3, Formula 2, Formula One eventually, which are all the same techniques and circuits and these kind of things. If you are an American boy, you know, you maybe develop your skills in oval racing, in dirt racing and these kind of things. So it's very difficult at the age of 30 or 25 or 35 to move, you know, to a new discipline and be as quick as them because they just born into that environment. So that was something that it was appealing on my head, and maybe I didn't need that, but it was just a kind of let's do something that it could be a legacy also for the future. Because in a way, a driver that cannot succeed now and get to Formula One, they cannot be frustrated because they didn't make it. They're just phenomenal drivers that they will find, you know, their way in different disciplines and they still fulfill, you know, a little bit their dreams.",0,Alonso
"That I still able to learn and Formula One didn't block my senses of learning things, you know, and also the humble approach to many things, which in Formula One is very easy to lose as well, because we live in this bubble that everything is good for us. Everyone is taking care of us. We travel in the last day, we do our job, we go back home, and we have all the privileges. And then when you go in Dakar and you know, you are two weeks in the middle of nothing on a tent, obviously you are not anymore in a five star hotel or you don't have all the privilege and you still need to change, you know, your suspension, your tires and cleaning your windscreen.",0,Alonso
"I think because my family and coming back to my family, this is probably the first and only advice they gave me always, you know, to stay humble, to stay who we were always in our family and taking all the advantages that this life can bring us, you know, economically and the status and everything that, you know, is part of Formula One circus as well. But from time to time also, I go back to Spain. I spend one week with my family and that week is kind of a reset, you know, of, you know, the last two weeks that was an unreal life, you know, and this was a bubble. But now we go back to the base and you know, we go to the supermarket, we see friends, we just chat, we play cards, whatever. This is the life that I will live, you know, for the next 40 or 50 years of my life and the life also that I want to live in the next 40 or 50 years.",0,Alonso
"I think they have this humble approach of everything. Yes, but also they have high discipline on everything they do because they had to, in the past, you know, to get their jobs, to finish the universities, to be on time on a interview for a job. You know, they have to work hard for their things. So that discipline, that self-confidence as well, which I think they have in their things, you know, in their lives. They have this confidence of what they're doing. Yeah, I think that the values that we all grew up in our families, that sometimes in professional sport you can lose them because as I said, you are just living a life on a speed that is unreal. You know, because we go from one place to the next within 24 hours. We do seven or eight different things on a single day. So at the end of the day, driving the car is the least time of the day. We are one hour and a half sitting in the car but then we have 14 or 15 hours of different activities, acting, photo shooting, meeting prime ministers, you know, things that we are not able to deal sometimes. And at the age we get to Formula One or do professional sports and these kind of things are just dragging you a lot of energy. ",0,Alonso
"I'm sure, yes. I don't remember maybe specifically one now, but from time to time, they are very honest with things that you may think or comments that you say or you know, things that for them they are not that important. And you know, or even sometimes I remember they had to deal with a lot of media attention, even at the front of the door of their house or paparazzi when we go summer together with my parents or whatever, these kind of things that I may get the stress as well because I don't want that they get disturbed by all these things. But, you know, from time to time, they tell me, ""Hey, this is not a problem. You know, they're taking a picture. You know, we are just sitting here having good time. So if they are happy with that picture, you know, it's their life and it's their job."" And maybe sometimes I don't see it that way, you know, because it's like they are stealing, you know, our privacy and our family time. But I understand what they're saying as well because it's like, okay, this is life and Fernando, calm down, you know, you cannot do, you cannot change the world, you cannot make justice on on everything that you see in our days. You know, there are things that are like this and you have to live happy with those.",0,Alonso
"Yeah, sometimes I think they have because they are less, let's say, less competitive than what I am. They are often, you know, happy with anything that happens on a race weekend or in my life or whatever problems that I have. They normally are a good balance for me because for them it's, oh, I feel that it's less important. So when I get stressed about, you know, whatever, a small thing about the race or about losing two points because we did this mistake or it happened that thing or that incident or whatever, I see from them and I hear from them that this is very good, still very good. And I remember the first ever race in Formula One, my debut in 2001 with Minardi that I called my father on Sunday morning of the race and I said, ""Okay, it's two hours to the race. So yeah, let's see how it goes. We start with the soft tires and then we will stop in Lap 15 for the refueling."" Because back then it was the refueling in Formula One. And he said, ""Okay, you know, I don't care. Whatever the strategies and the team thinks is the best for sure is the best. Try to enjoy because maybe it's your last race."" And I said, ""What do you mean?"" And he said, ""We never know. You know, this is your first race, maybe you are not delivering or you are not quick enough or the team is not happy with you at the end of the race or whatever. And then you will always be able to say that you raced one Formula One Grand Prix. You know, you are a Grand Prix driver."" And so that the kind of approach that my family has that sometimes for me is very valuable and very helpful when I get the stress. And for them, everything is just a gift. It's just an extra and this is very good.",0,Alonso
"I saw a lot of things. First was the love that the people had towards my career and my job. Because when I stopped in 2018, I was tired of traveling and all the things around Formula One. And as I said, not being able to compete for high things, but I don't know, I didn't have any perception or anything that maybe people thought about the sport or myself in general. But when I stop, the only thing that I receive every time that I was meeting people or any fan or yeah, people at the airport or in the hotels or whatever it was, ""You need to come back. You need to come back."" You know, this kind of thing, so the people, it was a surprise that they loved what we were doing, you know, because for me, the last few years before I stopped, it was like, you know, we are nearly anonymous here. You know, no one is seeing us and the sport was not maybe great as it is now with all this ""Drive to Survive"" on Netflix and all these things. So I thought that it was much less interest, but I was surprised of how much love I received from people. And then, yeah, I saw Formula One, which is in Motorsport, very different than other categories. Much more selfish, much more, yeah, glamorous in a way, but fake in another way. I think it was more Pure Motorsport, Le Mans or Indy or Dakar, for sure. But yeah, Formula One had this appeal, you know, the people want to attend to the races, wanted to watch on TV. I was watching also on TV the Formula One races. I appreciate a little bit more all the stuff that as a driver I didn't like before. So the national anthem, the parade lap, having a little bit more access to the media and the cameras, which when you are a driver, you hate those moments, but when I was just in my living room, I was missing those moments. And if one or two drivers were a little bit more smiley or a little bit more accessible, I think it was appreciated from home. So when I came back to the sport, I think I took a step more relaxed into those things and I was a bit more, or I took care of it bit more. I'm taking care of it a bit more of fans and TV and these kind of things because I understand the importance of it. And that was able only because I was two years out of Formula One.",0,Alonso
"Same, I regret that, I regret that. When I won the two championships back in Renault, my Ferrari time. I mean, it was good. But you are so focused on the next race, on the next weekend. You finish one race, you may win the race and you go to the airport and when you are in the plane, you're thinking about next weekend. So you land at home and you text your engineer, ""You know, we need to test software at the rear because, you know, the traction was very bad in this race, you know, at the end of the race,"" these kind of things. And yeah, I think with age and now at this point of my career, it is like the podiums of this year, it seems that when I re-watch the race on TV, I seem the happiest in the podium and I was third and two times second. But it's because I'm able to enjoy more those kind of moments and yeah, celebrating every weekend is part of my thing now. ",0,Alonso
"Yeah, I had that feeling and that if I was enjoying too much, it was like I was not professional or I was not wanting that success. But yeah, you realize with time and with maturity that you can do both things and you can work hard, you can be very professional, but at the same time you have to give back something to the people that worked for you and the people that are supporting you. You know, if it's your team or your marketing guys or your media or just the fans on the grand stands, you know, they are there for you and you need to give something back.",0,Alonso
"I think it links a little bit with the preparation and the way that I approach things and races, you know, the level of detail that I need to be calm before the race. Asking, you know, five times about the strategy and possible scenarios. What if I lose one place at the start, how this will transform our strategy. What if I gain one place at the start, we will stop one lap before, one lap later, which tires will be good to have on the car in that scenario, in the other scenario. Because I have that quantity of information before the race, when I see that one car, you know, had a bad stop, I immediately go back to what we saw in the morning and that car, having that bad stop and losing a little bit of time will maybe give us the opportunity to maybe do extra three laps with this tire because we are not under pressure or there are no threats from behind or whatever. So maybe I comment that on the radio and they're surprised like how, you know, Fernando can, after a bad Ferrari pit stop think that we can extend three laps our next stop. It's not that I realize there and I process all that information is that the information was inside already from Sunday morning when we review that strategy and possibilities. And because it's a communication between the team and me, we know that we are talking in the same page. So it's not that they didn't know that and they are surprised and my suggestion is going forward. Actually it was their suggestion and it was their strategy and it was their information. I'm just remembering what we saw a few hours ago.",0,Alonso
"No. I could be a little bit lazy or not lack of motivation, but yeah, a little bit, not fully on it. Maybe during the week of the race, maybe the training or the preparation. Sometimes we receive a document on the week before the race about the circuit changes, about all these things, maybe I didn't read it in detail or something like that because I was not, yeah, really motivated to that weekend. But always that change when I start a free practice on Friday. When I start a free practice on Friday and you see yourself 12, you want to be in 10th because you think that that's maybe possible. If you are seventh, okay, you know, the P5 did a mega lap today. He maybe don't repeat that lap tomorrow. We can be top five. So very easily, you get motivated during the weekend. And so by Sunday, when I close the visor and the race starts, I've been always a hundred ready. ",0,Alonso
"It is just executing the race as a robot, basically. No emotion. And just there is only one way to see the checkered flag faster than any other possibility. Then drive as efficient as possible, taking care of the tires, the battery. We have very complex hybrid engines on the cars and these kind of things. So when I closed the visor, I remember everything that we spoke on Sunday morning with the team, with each of the areas that are important in terms of performance, the engine, the tires, aerodynamics,  the strategy and just, I try to deliver what they told me that is the most efficient way to see the checkered flag. So they did their part, they studied the strategy, the simulations and all the tools we have run millions of possibilities and scenarios and we chose one, we pick up one that will be the fastest for us. So I take like that responsibility to deliver that job and as the last chain in the team. And yeah, I try to have no emotions. Said that, you know, when you are racing there is this high adrenaline, there are overtaking, there are things they don't go as planned and in that moment, obviously, you are very emotional and you are at 180 heartbeat on your adrenaline so still a human behind and very enthusiastic about what we are doing. So that's the beauty of the sport, that even if you want to do something with no emotion, everything comes alive in certain moments of the race.",0,Alonso
"Well, failure is needed in life and you have to have down moments. You have to learn from many things. And the sport in general, as you said, 90% of the times, you will not succeed or 99. You know, it's easy enough if you succeed one to be worth all the things that you've been trying for many years. And I think, yeah, not winning and not delivering what you will love to and things like that are essential for any human being to really get better every time. So you need to have that level of confidence and that level of discipline as we said before, to separate what is a disappointment to what it can be a lesson, you know, and get better for the next time.",0,Alonso
"Yeah, I mean you need to... It is extremely painful. You know, it's real pain when you remove the helmet and you are not on the podium and you see others celebrating and you know, it is something that you cannot digest sometimes for few hours until you get at night at home or you have to sleep and the next morning you try to process everything that happened. If it was a mistake from yourself or if it was a strategy mistake or if it's just, you know, in our sport that the car is not fast enough, how to make that car as fast as as the competition. And I think it's just, you know, you need to have, again, a plan and you have to have a program in your head that you are willing to respect and you have to start with your self respect and then to your team and to your teammates and everyone that is working in the team, knowing that, you know, there is a plan to achieve certain goal. There is a plan to get better physically. There is a plan to get better on the straights. There is a plan of having less mechanical issues because we are, you know, getting stronger on the reliability side. We are hiring two new people. We are building these new facilities, you know, to have a stronger gearbox for the future. Once you get that on your head, I think it's very easy to keep going and to keep, you know, delivering your best. If you have any doubt or if you don't have not confidence on your team or you lost the trust of your mechanic, or if you have two bad pit stops and you never talk about that or you never put in plan an improvement to the system because definitely there are some weaknesses on the system, if you don't do that, for sure, it is very difficult to get the motivation or to deliver. So you need to find and to search for excellence in everything you do. And once you have that, then you have to respect that plan and to achieve that.",0,Alonso
"It is difficult to really say one. No, I don't think much. I will probably, yeah, if you go back in time, you know, you change things. Winning a championship with Ferrari, that will be probably the first thing that I choose if I can go back in time. 2010, 2012 we were within few laps to winning a championship and that probably could have changed a little bit the outcome of many things and the history behind of few things. And I was disappointed for sure to miss those. And then, yeah, as I said, you know, because this is difficult to change and you never know and you depend of many other people and other teams as well and performance of the cars and things, it is difficult to regret something because this is out of your hands. What I regret for sure and we touch before was not to enjoy more my time, my career. You know, I know that I'm at the end of of it and there is a new life, you know, in few years time for me without driving. And when I will look back to my career, I will see a lot of good things and good friendships and incredible experiences. But it's like, I should have enjoyed more and if I had the opportunity to live my exact life once more, maybe I don't change anything on my teams or my choices or this Ferrari maybe title or whatever. I will just change to live a little bit more all those moments and try to have more memories from those moments. I won the championship in Brazil 2005 and six and I hardly remember anything from those afternoons and nights, which is sad, you know. So these are the kind of things that I will change.",0,Alonso
"Yeah, 80% is is just about executing everything 20% of the time and in your head, it's just plan B, plan C. So you go to your plan initially, but yeah, because if something goes wrong, you need to have something and don't panic and you have a plan but that's not the optimum. So you don't want to to spend too much time in the sub optimum.",0,Alonso
"Yeah, exactly like that. I would love to win the championship once again, but it's not the highest priority. I think I'm enjoying the process of, especially now with Aston Martin to become a contender for the future. I'm loving the time with the team, how we are all growing up in many different areas. I will try 99% Dakar again, which if one day and that's something that is, it is not that the third world title is less of a priority. It is a priority. But winning Dakar one day, it is a high priority for me as well. I will maybe have to attempt that race eight, 10 years or whatever until maybe one day I got lucky and I can fight for the win. But if I win in Formula One in endurance racing and Dakar, that will feel for me something special as a driver and as a person. So those kind of challenges are in my head at the moment.",0,Alonso
"I would say discipline is one. Integrity, yeah and confidence. I like the people that has this power of convincing you know, when they talk about something because they are so sure of what they are doing and this is very powerful.",0,Alonso
"I will go back to my school time because I don't know, when you are young, you are free. You have endless possibility of, you know, doing whatever you want in the future and with your life and this is kind of a feeling that you miss later in your life, you know? So college, I think, is beautiful time.",0,Alonso
"Nothing really. I think you lose your privacy. This is a very important thing and you have to deal with, and we are all different in terms of dealing with this thing. For me, it is not easy coming from where I come from and things. Losing your privacy and not being anonymous anymore in any place in the world and constrained yourself to do certain things at certain times or just to avoid, you know, stress, that's a high price to pay.",0,Alonso
"Probably yes. Yeah. Yeah, I love kids and yeah, probably not being in the sport and not being a Formula One driver, I probably would have my own family by now, but that's something that you never know. So I don't think too much on this.",0,Alonso
"To enjoy more, as we said. To take care more about, you know, your friends, family. It's not that I didn't take care, but you know, it seems that you always want to spend more time with them. My grandparents, that they are not with me anymore. These kind of things, you know, if you could have, you know, a conversation with yourself, you know, a few years ago, you will advise these kind of things.",0,Alonso
"On the personal life? My parents are always giving me, you know, the sense of being a good person, humble, trying to take care of yourself and the others. I think this is something that I always appreciated and my parents are always giving me the best advices on the professional side of things. I remember when I was in go-kart, I was 13 or something like that and I finished second in the world championship the first year that I attempted. And I was so happy. It was my second international race in the podium, in the world championship that was just incredible. And I arrived to the team and I seemed that I was the only one happy. So the head of mechanics back then in go-kart in my team came to me and pulled me in one of the side of the tent and he said, ""Be happy, enjoy, but there is not much to celebrate. Second is the first losers. In a sport, you win or you don't. You know, to finish second, seventh or 11th is the same. There is only one guy with a trophy and it's not us. So I understand your emotion, but this is nothing to celebrate."" It was shocking because I was 13 and I thought that that was really, you know, good, you know, and that was really bad, you know, for a kid. But then with time I understood that that was a good advice in general, you know, especially in the sports, or when you are competing for something, you win or you don't. You know, it's not that you train and you are here at the simulator or at the races or whatever to finish seventh. And seventh is the same as 17th, you know, there is only one guy winning.",0,Alonso
"I think self-confidence. Being prepared for everything you do in life. You know, you cannot underestimate even the easiest thing in life or something that you do every day in your job or whatever and you get used to. There is always something that it will change one day, technology will change, something will change and you have to adapt to that and deliver that extra again because there is a new way of doing things. And yeah, the world is changing, you have to adapt and you have to deliver something extra. And so you cannot be happy with anything. You have to always search for something better.",0,Alonso
"Not much, because I was in the simulator this morning and I should have prepared even more but I hope it's still enjoyable. I do like reflecting. I do agree and yeah, I think it is in life. It is not only in sports in general. I think when you are 20 you see life in a way. And when you are 40, you see it in a completely different way. Unfortunately, life, when you have the experience of 40, you will love to have 20 because you have your body ready for the knowledge that you have at 40. But in motorsport, I think at the age of 40 and the knowledge that you have at 40 is not a big disadvantage not to have the body of 20 because we still, you know, driving cars and it's more a mental thing and create automatism on your hands, steering wheel, all these kind of things. So I think at the moment I feel good because my sport is good at the age of 40 and that knowledge and it's still delivering. If I was a footballer or a tennis player or whatever, that will be more painful.",0,Alonso
"What is high performance? High performance is performing at the very best level of yourself, your abilities. And I reckon it's as simple as that. The best of your own abilities 'cause high performance is different for everyone. Of course, high performance within Formula One is a little bit more complicated, but it's still the edge of technology, always pushing the boundaries, always trying to find improvements. So maybe more in that direction. High performance is trying to push the boundaries, always trying to find better of yourself. ",1,Lando
"I do, but isn't necessarily myself. Like I think the best thing for me is the people I have around me. My manager, my trainer, my dad, the people I'm with pretty much in everyday life. I've been with like my manager and trainer for the last 11, 12 years almost, 10 years? So they almost know me better than I know myself in some aspects. And as yourself, it's easy to get like caught up in a loop, and kind of get complacent with some things. They're always there to give me a little kick when I need it and keep me grounded, all these kind of things. But yeah, for me, they're like the most important thing. But as you get older, I think you realize more and more what I've realized more and more for myself, what works me, what doesn't, what kind of keeps me motivated, what keeps me wanting to work hard. 'Cause it's easy to just kind of miss a training session, miss this, miss that, and you kind of realize the consequences that has quite quickly. So yeah, but the people around me are the most important thing for me. ",1,Lando
"It's tricky because there's obviously so many nice things which obviously come with that. And I'm lucky and thankful to be in the position that I've been in with my dad doing so well and so on. And that's led on to me having and being given many good opportunities to always be with a good team, to have a manager and a trainer since I was 12, 13 years old. But I think the one thing is that my mom and dad have done very well, I would say, is keep me grounded and kind of realize or live the life, let's say, as normally as possible, not get carried away in any way. I'm definitely, I can say I'm privileged, but not in the way that I get whatever I want. I get nice cars from my dad and all of this stuff. There's many things which my dad has given to me and I say invested in me, but it's the investment, not a given. Then I need to pay back that investment and reward him and use what he's given me to show it's all been useful and not a waste of time. So I think just my parents have been very good at keeping me in that state. ",1,Lando
"I have lived with like lived with the comments you get from other people. I guess already at a young age, maybe you just don't see it and realize it as much how much people talk, and social media then takes over that side of it. ",1,Lando
"Of course, yeah. 'Cause we like, we used to have a motor home and we used to already be with the good teams and stuff like that. So since you pretty much start already, you have the judgment of this guy's got all the best stuff and they don't and stuff like that. But there are many people that also have other things which are just as good and so on. And there are many circumstances when it doesn't come down to, do you have a better engine? Do you have a better chassis? Do you have a better people you work with? A lot of it does come down to you in the end. ",1,Lando
"I wouldn't say like I wanna be better than my dad because it really like a very, I guess, a very different profession and live a different life, but many things which wanna make me not get the comments of I'm in the position of where I am because of him. And I think like between my dad and I, like, we never wanted, I never wanted him to pay for me to come into Formula One, that was like one goal. He could support me until Formula One or let's say to a Formula Two to get to that point, give me those opportunities and so on, but I like personally as a feeling, I wouldn't want to come into Formula One having to pay for it and be, although it's kind of just a bit of a mentality thing, not have the mentality of I'm I'm not here 'cause I don't deserve it, I'm here 'cause I've paid for it. I never really wanted that at all. And I feel much prouder to say that I'm here because McLaren brought me on and I was McLaren junior driver, they brought me on, I got better and then I was their official driver. So like it makes me much happier saying that than the opposite one. But yeah, like I have to know to a certain extent, I'm lucky for the opportunities that I got and the fact he could just support me into a Formula Two was already a lot more than what people get. So I also know that on the flip side.",1,Lando
"Definitely not, definitely not. 'Cause like when I started, I wasn't, let's say I was, I had a bit of a natural talent for it, but I wasn't amazing. It's not like I started and won everything. And",1,Lando
"No, 'cause I think for the first, what, three, four, five years of my life of doing carting, I'm doing it 'cause I'm young and it's just a hobby, it's 'cause that's what I love at that point in my life. I don't think for me anyway, like I'm at a point where I think, and this is what I wanna do with my career when I'm eight years old, it was just a lot more I love doing this is I just wanna do this for now more when I was like 13 was, my goal is Formula One, how can I start to put a plan in place? But no, I wouldn't say it was hard. I think I learned a lot and of course, then I had good people around me to tell me how to do better. And I had to put in the effort to become a better driver. It wasn't like, it just came completely naturally to me, definitely certain elements were natural. ",1,Lando
"And I think if you want to be one of the best, you gotta have some natural for where you can just jump in and be pretty good. But then especially to be in Formula One, you gotta it's that next level, what brings you those final hundreds and that final 10th and stuff. And there are hundreds of thousands of people who can drive a car well. And you probably could jump in a car and do a pretty good job straight away, but then it's those final few little, little things and that isn't all down to who has the most money and those kind of things. A lot of that is down to working with the people around you. A bit of is just experience the more kind of testing you get to do and so on the better. But I still drive alongside teammates and had people I was practicing with every week and stuff like that who aren't in the position I am now. So there's no excuse for why that's just suddenly helped me a lot more than them. But yeah, that final bit is down to the determination of the driver, how much effort he's willing to put in, the sacrifices he wants to make from such a young age.",1,Lando
"I guess like the social life of school was probably the initial one and you probably don't really realize that until all you're a bit more mature and you kind of hit 20 or I say more like 18, I would say, when you think like don't really have any friends from school and from growing up, like all of my friends are now from just from racing, from carting and so on. And very few, every now and then I maybe get a message from my mates from school, but it's not like we're best mates anymore. It's just like we knew each other and that was all, so yeah, I kind of like missed side of it. I didn't know like I guess I missed what I don't know about life from living up and going to uni and going out every night, all those kind of things, That's the life I didn't live, but I could never changed that for what I've got now.",1,Lando
"Just like etiquette and being polite, I guess like your interactions with other people, never thinking that better or more deserved than anyone else that I work with. And I think that shows in like a lot of what I do now in Formula One, I think personally, like I don't just turn up for Formula One and just like I get paid and go home. I love everything that goes into it, working here and in MTC with the mechanics, some nights, staying late, I do the tours, I go and see everyone. I do some of my work experience here and just kind of getting to know everyone. Before I was the driver, race driver for McLaren, then I would stay with the mechanics. I would pack up the garage and take the car apart after the races and stuff like that I just love. ",1,Lando
"No, no, no, definitely not expected. The other, I would say what is expected is the opposite side, is just seeing the Formula One driver rock up in all the fancy clothes, do the work and then jet off home. ",1,Lando
"I would say so. I was what? 17 at the time? 17, 18, so I knew like the values of people and how much of a difference that can make, how much, if I help them, how much they can help me and just the improvements you can get from doing that. But it was never something I had to do. And honestly, it's something I do less of now because I value my time a little bit more of being able to go home and relax a little bit before I go into the next races and stuff, especially with how busy we are nowadays. But at that time it was solely 'cause it's just what I love to do. I know I like spending time with them then, I go out to dinner and just taking the car apart, I think it's cool. Like who wouldn't want to get into a Formula One car and basically break it all up. So all of that was just for my enjoyment and stuff I was interested in at the same time, it was just an added bonus from that. And that was that I gotta spend time with them and they liked it and they liked the help. ",1,Lando
"From the second point first would be, it's just an extra opportunity for me to try and do better than someone else, like there's no downside from doing it. There's no negative. Like what else you gonna do? You're gonna go home and play on the Xbox in the hotel for a bit or just go and grab dinner a couple hours earlier, like it doesn't for me, that's not like there's no gain for me in doing that. And for my own career and what I knew there was enjoyment in it and there's the bonus of working with the team more, and our relationship's improving and so on. And knowing that I'm, I didn't know at the time what I guess more likely to be in the racing seat a couple years later, it's only gonna be a good thing for me that we have that relationship and bond together. So I think, yeah, those are the good things. The bad things of what I saw in other drivers is I would say, it's more what you hear from people, but the attitudes of different drivers or different people how like not all but like how they would just talk to people and how they would talk to them just in front of cameras, rather than as soon as the camera's gone, they would just go back to being the racing driver and not the team player. Just some more things like that, which you hear and just think like if it was the opposite way around and I was that person, I would hate the fact that these people talk about me like that. And I would hate that people talk about behind my back of me in a bad way, because of me thinking I'm much better and above everyone else. So that's really something I would hate. ",1,Lando
"I think the main thing was bringing like their work and effort and everything that they put into it and just rewarding them simply. A lot of what I... There's always the time when you have to speak to the teams and all the team here. And I get real nervous in front of the the hundreds of people that are there. But I feel like there's just so much responsibility on me and the amount of effort and time that's gone into building what I drive. And then like, I'm that final piece of the jigsaw that just needs to go out and do the job that they're all expecting. So for me, it's just like, I'm not a part of that chain and I just wanna finish off the job that they've started and that's from building the car and the drawings that they start off with all the way to the computers, to the actual thing and then putting it on track. So the only things I said is like, I just wanna do them proud and put together their story of going from a piece of paper to the, hopefully a trophy the end of the day, but that's a tough one. ",1,Lando
"There's a heck of a load of people, so that a few makes it like more nerve wracking and you get a lot more nervous from that side of it. But the main thing for me is like just enjoying things that I do like whether or not I would still be here if I enjoyed it, I'm not too sure. But the main thing I do it, the reason I do it's 'cause I enjoy it. So if I wanna enjoy things and my enjoyment doesn't come from me thinking like I don't need to care about the others, a lot of it comes from me getting to know them and spending some time with them having chats.",1,Lando
"When you're behind the wheel like it's hard to think of anything directly, something come from when you're not behind the wheel whether it's just you need a bit of help with something or you just need to contact someone and just 'cause you're like you've been nice to them and you've spoken to them and spent 10 minutes with them or something. They would just go that extra little mile for you and they'll get you something in return and not like that's how I work my life and I just want favors from people. But just you put some effort in with them and just spend some time with them and they'll do the same for you. ",1,Lando
"When you're driving behind the car, it's difficult like think there's so many parts that come to it. There isn't like just one thing which makes that little bit of a difference. I think I couldn't give you an example of when I'm nice to someone like the, how it returns to me when I actually drive the car, but I think there's more just how everything works in the background and a trust and like a responsibility and so on that people will give to you when you give it to them. And if people are staying here late and so on, or if I've had some problems with something, then yeah, they would just go outta and help me rather me just being someone that they work for or with there's just like I'm their friend or they're made or whatever it is and that definitely makes a difference. ",1,Lando
"Sure. So I think all of it would already start at the first race. Just like we kind of spoke about the amount of people which are here working on everything, and like at that point I just feel like just another driver and I don't feel like I'm way better than everyone else at this point or necessarily believe I'm much better than everyone else at this point. But like I'm on the grid, and I just think like so many people are watching me. I have so much to deliver for the whole team. And I am a new driver in Formula One. There's a lot of eyes on me. There's expectations. You don't wanna let McLaren down, one of the most historic teams in Formula One. So like that already just puts that pressure on. I think when things start going or become tougher or when you just don't... ",1,Lando
"The media, like the media's one of the biggest things, how the media portrays you is one of the biggest things. So when things start to go wrong, when he makes a couple of mistakes and the media have a little dig at you and then fans and people on social media start to have a more of a dig at you, that's when that self doubt that sometimes I would have, like that grows when people kind of just add on to that. And I was never, I struggled a lot in like the final of years to get into Formula One. So Formula Three, Formula Two, having that belief of am I better than them? Am I the same as them? Am I a little bit worse? Am I good enough to be in Formula One? ",1,Lando
"And that kind of stays even when I was in that first year of Formula One, am I good enough to go around Monaco and deliver that lap in Q3 when it comes? Or if I'm in the position to be on a podium or on top of the podium, am I there? Am I gonna be able to deliver it when it counts? But that's okay, and I can live with that quite easily on when maybe I made those little mistakes and so on, but when people add to it and you see comments, that's when you like start to feel a lot worse about yourself. And especially when I'm in my first year, it's like, I know my parents have put so much effort into helping me get to there, the team have all the expectations, the whole world they're watching. And then you just think like, if this goes wrong, it's my first year in Formula One, if this guy's wrong, what am I gonna do if I'm not in Formula One? 'Cause this is all I've lived for my whole life. I wasn't smartest guy in school and I struggled quite a bit in school. Like what am I going to fall on if all of this goes wrong? And just having those thoughts is already",1,Lando
"Exactly. And was putting on like the smiley face for the cameras and all those kind of things, like that's not the easiest thing. But you just get to that point when like even I had maybe three or four races where I was just struggling a little bit, and I had Carlos as my teammate at that point, And he was doing a very good job. He was getting to grips with the car and extracting everything out of it. And just three or four races where like he beat me and I was just like, what do I do? I just got to the point where I don't know, is this the end of it? what if I can't just find something else? I didn't know what to do at that point.",1,Lando
"It is. Especially 'cause I'm a guy who doesn't like to talk too much. I guess sometimes I do, but a lot of the time I like to keep things like hidden and talk inside and stuff. And when I have problems, I tend not to talk about them, especially back then. Definitely didn't talk about them as much as what I do now. So a lot of it is my mind, how I like to think of it more on my own and",1,Lando
"I'd say too much. I'm definitely my biggest critic, but like I think a lot of pros and you see footballers or Formula One drivers, whoever it is, I think they're their own biggest critics by a long way. But I think you need to learn the balance of it, and also know when to put yourself on the back a little bit and say you've done a good job, but there was a lot less of that than I was of bringing myself down. So always having that self doubt and that being critical on myself and just thinking on my own and not like allowing others to help me as much as I could 'cause I always thought it would be my fault not someone else's and I would hate to ever blame it on someone else. ",1,Lando
"Exactly. And until that point, I've only ever done one year in every category I've done. So I've not spent those multiple years like I've done now in Formula One. And I just hate to use it. If someone could say to you why is he done better than you? Here I go, he's just more experienced. Like it's such an easy thing to say and to use. And I just really never wanted to use it. But like now I have a much better understanding and I can go, I know I didn't do that as well because of the experience, but I know at that point I would never have used it. ",1,Lando
"I could never use the experience as the excuse. Like that was one I can... Like now I feel like I can use it 'cause I've learned about how much it can actually change. But at that point I just never, I would never wanna use the excuse apart from it's myself.",1,Lando
"I think there's just a lot of hours and days, probably months of it just like swirling in your head and just you're thinking things over and over again, like why has he done that better? How has he done that better? what's he thinking of? How did he spend his time? And then you do it to yourself like what am I not doing good enough? Why am I not doing it as good as him? Is it because of this or that or this or that? And you just come up with all of these excuses for yourself. But then I kind of got to a point when because it was four races instead of the three, it was four like what differences like kind of got to the point when I started to realize like what else can I do now to make some to changes? ",1,Lando
"I think it gets to like when you're thinking of things for so long, like you start to, I think I was luckily at a point where I could think of a couple of positive things every now and then, and I'm like, I'm in Formula One, there must be some things that I do very well. And. ",1,Lando
"And it was like coming here spending a little bit more time with my engineers, sitting down, just refreshing everything, kind of starting again a little bit and trying to get some of that self confidence back inside 'cause that's one of the biggest things. Like if I go out and I just think, I'm confident I can go out and break at this point and I deliver the lap when I need to, just thinking of these little things can already start to just click and start to just make things turn over a little bit. And that's when like small things started, but it's just getting to that point which is the difficult part.",1,Lando
"Yes. I think what's tricky is like sometimes just understanding that. And I think that's when people suffer even more is when they maybe don't see those kind of things. But I think I got, I was still able to understand a few of them and think, I'm here because I'm good enough in many, many circumstances and with many things, what are they and just maximize them. So you kind of think how can I still maximize what I know I'm good at? And when I started to think a little bit more on those, that's when you then think of some of those other things you might definitely not be as good at. And then that's when I could start to pick out a few more of the pieces and think, okay, now I can just start to focus a little bit it on this and a little bit on this and then you can start taking those little, little steps forward. ",1,Lando
"But for me almost, it was realizing what I'm good at first. And then it kind of, you don't get lost with everything you're thinking of. You're not thinking, am I actually fast enough? 'Cause that's such a general term to use, it's I know I'm fast enough. I know I'm good in these circumstances. And then it starts to even out like the graph of, okay, these are the couple places I'm definitely not good enough. And it's just that I can focus on them when you have something to focus on rather than just being completely lost with so many things. And then you just of them, you speak about them a little bit and then you spark conversations and then you talk about them and you just get some slightly better understandings and then you start to gain some momentum and go from there again. ",1,Lando
"Yeah, especially when you're in a competition side of it and you wanna win. when you want that, that you want that reward something that's gonna give you so much pleasure and the team pleasure, it's easy to think of it that way, but I guess, there's like when I think of I'm good enough to be in Formula One, there's also things which I will be thinking of and ways of how I work, which I also gonna be good enough, or good building blocks, at least. So I think there was those parts of me which I knew were strong enough to like kind of start to realize these things and create a bit of change. And I was lucky I kind of had those things at least to be able to work from and to start thinking slightly differently and so on. Of course, like if I didn't have that, I could still be in that bit of a spiral and not be thinking I'm still good enough to be in this position and stuff like that. But as soon as I started a little bit and I don't think I just need to go out and beat him all of a sudden, but like, how am I gonna beat him and the processes, then you start to realize how you can make change. ",1,Lando
"Well, I think like one thing I've not really mentioned as much, or I mentioned a little bit earlier was the one thing for me that motivates me more than anything is enjoyment and just fun, it's a nice little word, but it's like an immature word to use, but it's a fun and enjoyment. Like if I'm enjoying something, it makes me work harder and makes me want it more. And then it's that a positive spiral of if I work harder, reward myself more, I enjoy it more and I worked harder and then it just, you keep me going up. And I say, maybe I got to a point where I wasn't enjoying it as much and",1,Lando
"it'll be in the first season, like maybe halfway towards three quarters of the way through. And I just was like, because you're thinking of so many things, you're not just thinking of like, I'm driving a Formula One car in fucking America or Japan or whatever it is which is just awesome. And you start thinking about it and just clouds your judgment, like you said. So the first few things are like, maybe I would say sparked it off is I need to enjoy it. And I think even like my manager and my trainer could kind of tell what was going on a little bit at this point. And there was a little bit more time spent on having some days away enjoying my life and maximizing my days at home with my family or with my friends, whatever it was, going out a little bit, going out to dinners again. ",1,Lando
"And that kind of just frees your mind up a little bit. So I think maybe the first key point is enjoyment. Are you enjoying it? Yes or no. And kind of understanding, can you enjoy it? Like is maybe not easy for people to enjoy the job that they have or whatever they they're doing, but I know I could enjoy Formula One and the job I'm in. So I know I could enjoy it is just understanding what kind of brought that to me and so on. And then you can go into those start kind of picking up on those details, those smaller details again. But for me, the main thing is the enjoyment, and how can I do that. Once I get back into that mentality, it's then what we just spoke about is the picking up on what am I good at? What do I know I'm strong in and then finding the places that you're weak in and kind of just going from there.",1,Lando
"So I guess it starts within the race, those final a few moments leading Lewis has caught me, but I managed to hold him off for five, six, seven, eight laps. And that's, there's that glimmer of hope like I'm holding him behind, there's only five, six laps to go, like I know I can continue to do this. And then the rain's coming in and there's just that buildup of pressure like you're focusing, you see one little puddle or a bit of a shiny surface, you know it's wet and all these things. And you're then in that communication with the team, you're trying to give feedback to them, they're trying to help you. ",1,Lando
"And I remember getting a little bit shouty on their radio at the time, but not in like my engineer knows there's never anything against him, it's just, you're in the moment you just say things and it doesn't really matter, like it matters, and maybe that's one of the things I've learned now is it matters how it comes across but the time I was just like, I shout no or shout yes. But how they perceive it was kind of a small effect, kind of a small change or they start to think of something. ",1,Lando
"So obviously like we would go through all the video, we go through what everyone is thinking 'cause it's not just me and my engineer, you got strategists at the track. You have like the engineers, you got them strategists back here and MTC and they're all looking at every little bit of data. People who have done the pit stops onto the intermediate tires, people who are staying out, my pace, Lewis' pace. The big one, is there more rain coming? Is there not any more rain coming? And just going back over all of these things. And I guess like, I didn't realize how shouty I was on the radio. I come across as like a little kid, but it's not like I ever mean to you. It's just",1,Lando
"Yes, of course we spoke about that, but I think we've had like a kind of these conversations before and I think they just, they did kind of understand the situation I was in with Lewis is behind me a few laps to go, leading the race. Like even for them, there's more pressure, it's the first time we've been in situation, of course, I think Daniel won the weekend before. So they kind of already were a little already a little bit prepared for it, but it's, there were so many more factors this time. ",1,Lando
"But I guess you kind of need to then realize what can be having the big effect and what can't and me just saying, no, didn't change the outcome in any way, but there could be a time and a place when it does. And it could also, I could simply have given them a little bit more information at the same time, instead of just shouting no, I could have come, no, I'm happy on the slick tower at the minute, but it's very tricky and if it rains any more, then I'll need a pit, obviously, probably that in a more condenser way and a bit quicker and maybe that could have sparked something in their mind, which was maybe we see a little bit more rain coming, maybe you don't, whatever, it was lets pit, lets not pit. The fact was in the end of it, they didn't realize how much more rain was coming and how much worse it was about to get and I was only with with two laps to go. ",1,Lando
"And we did speak about it and I don't think it changed, let's say the overall outcome. I don't think what I said or how I said it changed the outcome of what we did, even if I just said no in like, no, I wouldn't like to pit in a nice way, it wouldn't have changed anything. But maybe people would've started to think slightly differently and so on. So you kind of never know, but yes, we went through everything that I said, how I said it, the effects that it could have on myself, on the teams, on how they then put it across to the other people who are then listening to them and so on. And the decisions which come from every little bit of information.",1,Lando
"We obviously made the decision and I think like what people to say don't realize as much is that Lewis was in his exactly the same position as me. Of course, he was in second, but didn't wanna pit either. He was happy with staying on slick tires, but the team told him it's about to rain a heck of a lot more, you need to pit. And that's like information that I didn't get given. And if they maybe said to me, it's about to rain a lot more, then I would've been like, okay, then, oh, I need a pit. So it would go both ways. it's stuff that I could have helped with with them and stuff that they could have given to me. And it's not still as simple as that. There's so many other factors and things that they're looking at and seeing and so on, but like as a simple way of putting it, that's what it came down to. ",1,Lando
"Like the next, let's say two, three, four days were pretty tough just 'cause it's like always been thinking that could have been my first win in Formula One. And I think as far I was like that could have been my only win in Formula One, my only chance to Formula One, you never know 'cause you don't know what car we're gonna have this year and next year and so on. But there's times when people's F1 careers only last a couple years or three, four years, whatever it is. So like could that have been my only chance to win a race in Formula One? And then you kind of like what we spoke about earlier, what could I have said differently? What could I have done differently? And I think of all of these things, but then when we sat down and just stopped for a little bit and you kind of review everything in a clean way and an efficient way, you pick apart the things we did well, the things we didn't do well and what could have been, what were the deciding factors with everything. ",1,Lando
"The main thing is to never like get caught up in a moment. So the moment of that was I'm leading a race, I got Lewis behind me, it's wet. I wasn't thinking as clearly as what I should have been thinking. And the more information I can just clearly give the team, the more they can understand the position that I'm in, how I'm feeling and the easier we can make decisions. 'Cause sometimes I maybe just say no and I expect too much of of them. I expect them to just know what I'm thinking, what I'm feeling when they don't, they can see data, they see the lines and graphs, whatever, but they're not behind the wheel so they don't know like, am I really like am I pushing like hell? If I got a little bit more, am I gonna be in the wall? Like all of these little things. So just kind of staying calm, which is such an easy thing to say, but doing it when you're in that circumstance is very different, but just clearing concise information is just always the best thing and them giving it to me in a way and vice versa is only gonna help us win races and get on the podium more often. So understanding that is the best thing. ",1,Lando
"So I think one of the main things which I came back from after Russia and having those few days off to think about it is, or were the first one is what could I have done differently? Again, just thinking of it like as a me fault, what could I have done differently? And then we listened to the radio and all of these things. And for me it was just, all I wanted to understand was, was it my fault? Yes or no? In the end, it is easier to like to say, no, like now, it wasn't my fault, but that doesn't mean like there's nothing I could have done better. And of course, we just kind of spoke about some of those things that I could have done better and should have done. ",1,Lando
"And already some of these things were put into practice I think a couple weeks later back in Turkey when it was drying out a little bit, it was hard to choose whether to go intermediates or slicks, went to box and so on. And it goes from the week of Russia, Mercedes looking like heroes, all clever, they made the best decision ever, we made the worst and it was completely flipped the next week. Mercedes made a terrible decision, went to box, we made a really good one, we gained, they lost. ",1,Lando
"And then it's just suddenly how quickly things can just change and flip. But already some of those decisions we made at that race in Turkey were affected and changed because of what happened in Russia. So we already put some of that into practice and it came out much better. But as a person, as a person from a personal note was understanding was it my fault? Yes or no? That's certainly I need to get off my chest nice and early. And then you look at the smaller things. what could I have said, which might have helped? ",1,Lando
"And it was down to that if it rained anymore, I couldn't have stayed out, I would've needed to box. And if they knew it was about to rain more, which is the thing that they didn't, then we would've made the decision to box, but they didn't have as much information as what they needed or didn't understand the information as well as they needed to, didn't get that across to me as well as we needed to. And maybe that little bit of information I could have given them could have changed things. Don't think it would've done. But there's always that next time when those things can can again, and we can try and do a better job. ",1,Lando
"Exactly. I'm much happier that it's happened in a time when I'm not going for a championship. I'm not going even for top three or top four. I'm going for six or seventh in championship. For me, it's not a big achievement to do something like that.",1,Lando
"No, I wouldn't. of course, I think of it, I can't lie. I think everyone on the grid would say, they thought about winning the race, and especially that one when I saw then Lewis, I think it was his hundredth race win. They just made me feel even worse like just gave him his hundredth race win. I've not even got one. And you see those a few cases where the outsiders won the race, you've got Mercedes and Red Bull who are always gonna win. But when Esteban won the race in Budapest. Who else won? I think Carlos won the race at some point or I dunno, a few different drivers won who won in Mercedes or Red Bull. And that's when he looks even cooler 'cause they're people in my position. ",1,Lando
I guess 'cause you always move those expectations. You always gonna up them and like what's the next step for you to achieve something. And you always wanna be satisfied by reaching the achievement. But I think in Formula One that's so difficult because it's not like a guarantee you're ever gonna win a race or be on the podium or anything like that. And that's could have nothing to do with you. It could just be 'cause of reliability or your car's not quick enough or the rain comes or whatever it is. ,1,Lando
"So it's never always gonna be your or fault. So maybe there's some things you can change here and there. But no, I think you need to understand when you get to Formula One, a race win doesn't necessarily mean your first place in the race. Like a race win for me two years ago in Austria was being third place. Zero chance, I would've ever won a race, impossible unless there was a crash or whatever. But in terms of actually achieving our max potential, it was different in third place and that's what I did. So I maybe would've been even happier winning the race, but there's no point thinking about it 'cause it just never would've happened. So I just had to be, feel like a race win was a P three for me and a bit of",1,Lando
"It's a tricky one 'cause though the first few times I really began to or I had a chance to race him were like Austria, you would say Russia a little bit, kind of, can I keep a seven time world champion behind me? These kind of things which like they do play in your mind a little bit.",1,Lando
"Yeah, 'cause like at that time I'm thinking, I'm not necessarily thinking exactly those words, but the thinking I'm like, I'm going around and you're just on a straight you think, what is he gonna try and do now? What has he understood or what's he learned over the last, whatever 20 years that he's gonna try and outsmart me on? Is it the battery? Is it the tires? Is it the engine mode? Is he gonna try and like pull back to make me feel like I'm comfortable and then pound and then have a go. And like all of these things playing on my head, what's he gonna try and outsmart me on? And yeah, those things definitely play on your mind a little bit on, especially like we spoke about the experience side of it. There's something he's gonna be more experienced than me on. I just need to be ready to anticipate what that might be. ",1,Lando
"I might know it, I might not, but I just gotta be ready for those kind of things. So once you then go through that little feeling you have, and those thoughts and you have an outcome, the outcome of the race obviously was not a good one. We should have won and we didn't. But the outcome of I managed to hold him off for as long as I could and he didn't just cruise past me. It wasn't like I made a mistake and he came past me. He didn't outsmart me. Then just gives it a little bit more confidence like, well, he didn't actually do anything outta this world and do something which I wasn't expecting or anything, and it was the same in Austria. Like there wasn't something, he just did that extra mile, which I was just like, wow, that's unbelievable. I covered the basics. There are smaller things which I need to be prepared for, but these things give you a big confidence boost once you achieve them. And it's just 'cause you kind of overthink it sometimes, it's easy to overthink things and that's when it can get much tricker than it needs to be. ",1,Lando
"I definitely like right now, I'm definitely in the best position I've been in. Not just like you said as a racing driver, but my just being a normal person away from the circuit. A bit of that has just come with making the mistakes and posting something I shouldn't have done or saying something I should have done. And you get, again, the experience of learning about these kind of things, learning how media can pick up on something so small or how especially fans",1,Lando
"There's not been one big thing, but there's just been like comments where I would've said something and like, it would've been probably about Lewis or Sebastian, one of the the drivers I respect my more than anyone",1,Lando
"That's the tricky thing because like what I meant, I would never mean something to have bad intentions, like that's just not the person I am to really hate someone, but I would never mean it, especially in an interview when I have nothing against a person, Lewis at this point or Mercedes, like what's the reason there's no gain for me to do so, that's just silly. So the fact people wanna put it across that way. And if people believe that, then they obviously just dunno me very well. But the obvious one is start, I gotta be more careful with what I say here and there. ",1,Lando
"But, you like once you kind of get through it a couple times and you maybe say two or three things, people start to just kind of have like a bit more of a belief in you in the things you say, rather than you just saying one comment, which is just outrageous and just kind of maybe the respect as well you gotta gain that little bit of respect by sometimes saying things that people don't agree with 'cause then you lose those, say fans, you lose those few people which are just like hate you for saying those kind of things. And I'm very happy to have people not following me anymore, if they kind of just wanna believe everything that they see in social media and things like that, because then they simply don't know who I am very well. So you just gonna accept it a couple times like it's you just gotta go through those hard times, being told off by the team and things like that. ",1,Lando
"But like you just kind of also realize that you have the right to say things that you want and not everyone's gonna agree with it. I never want people to think of me in a bad way or think like we spoke about it in the beginning that I'm think a miles better than everyone and I should have more right to do things and say things than other people. That's far from what I would ever believe and wanna lead to people to believe so. Yeah, it's hard 'cause I would always have the best intention, but just people understanding that is what was difficult. So just saying it like now and people listening to this and the more people believe like",1,Lando
"You get comfortable with people not liking it. That's something you just have to do. You have to get people with... You have to get comfortable with people not liking what you say here and there and just live with it. That's just a part of life, that's people, that's people, different opinions and",1,Lando
"Exactly. And I think before I was a little bit more in the middle, where I just, I would say these things, but I just didn't wanna people to have opinions on me. I just wanted to be nice and in the middle ground of everywhere whereas I guess now I feel like I can stand up for my own opinion a little bit more and say what I want a little bit more and understand that people are gonna be with me and some people are gonna be against me and I'm happy. But like I'm fine with that nowadays like that's just, I've understood that's life. That's always gonna happen as long as people and humans are around, that's just the were made and yeah, just gotta deal with it. But that's all. ",1,Lando
"Enjoy life, number one by mile, enjoy life, be kind, It'll help those people, make their day, make their week if I take one minute out of my day to go and sign a picture for a kid or something like sometimes it's not necessarily what you wanna go and do, but you just made that kids year sometimes, and it's just a cool feeling you get off it. So be kind 'cause you give to them and it'll give back to you eventually. Number three, Oh, those are the only two really. Number three, learn when you know you've done a good job and be happy with that and kind of then make work from there rather than just be",1,Lando
"No, no. There point changing something. Poor, I would love to go back to just when I was younger, I was always rude to my parents. (Lando laughs) So I'd love to be a bit nicer to 'em at times. Yeah, be nice to my parents. ",1,Lando
"I'm not a reader. No, I'm a nerd. I spend too much time on my screens and stuff. The only one that, two that I've read is and my engineer gave it to me, it's the one about New Zealand sweeping the sheds, everything, learning what it means to be a team player rather than ever thinking about yourself first, that's number one. And number two was the Subtle Arts of Not Giving a Fuck. Again, that's one of the things which is helped me like understand all of these things that go on when you get to Formula One and lead up to Formula One is understanding what you should care about and what you shouldn't. And that's made my life much easier.",1,Lando
"I would make it again because I've gotta live my life and achieve my own goals and not live someone else's life. But spending as much time with my family, I would say is number one, or like not having spent as much time with my family is what I would've done if I was just, I don't know, going to school and having a normal job and stuff like that. And the friends like the whole social side of it all. Yeah, that's definitely one thing I would. Look, it's a sacrifice I realize how much of a difference it's made now. And just as a family thing, like you just wanna spend more time with your family and it's always a nice thing.",1,Lando
"Oh, it's the obvious one, enjoy it. Enjoy it. I dunno, maybe what everyone says that, but for me it's just like a huge part of my life. I gotta enjoy everything I do, take time away from work sometimes you go and do things you want, but enjoy it. And if you don't enjoy it, suck it off and go and do something else. ",1,Lando
well a lot has changed since 2018 i've had uh two years in mclaren since then um and a year in ferrari and now i'm about to start my second year in ferrari so yeah actually my my time in in mclaren was really good fun as you guys all know and and now in ferrari's a bit of a new life but uh i think i've yeah i've grown a lot as a driver as a person i've had my my first podiums my life has gone to the better so i cannot complain at all ,0,Sainz
well um 2018 i was coming off the back of um let's say not an ideal or a bit of a tough year with renault and [Music] at that point i was signed by by mclaren and i probably got my two best years in formula one up to date so thanks to those two really good years or let's say a very good 2019 i got called by by ferrari and and i had to leave a team that i really liked like mclaren and a team that i felt at home with to move to to a team like ferrari so yeah i've just grown in terms of getting to know two of the best teams actually the two best teams in formula one and and and having to experience how different two formula one teams can be and and how i need to adapt to completely two different cars two different cultures so as a driver i've gone through a lot in the last let's say three years,0,Sainz
it all started i think now i can say at the end of 2019 i had my podium in brazil then a great season finale in in in abu dhabi where i claimed six in the driver's championship in abu dhabi already my dad had a quick conversation with mattia and and we started the having our first contact no then in 2020 the pandemic arrived and we were all in our homes locked up we were talking now about february so a couple months later after abu dhabi and um yeah all of a sudden all the negotiations started to take place during covet lockdown to the point where when it was time to sign my new contract ,0,Sainz
i wake up in a morning at eight o'clock in back at home in the middle of lockdown and uh and i go to have some coffee and breakfast and suddenly my dad tells me let's go we need to sign a ferrari contract and i was still in my pajamas and and i signed my ferrari contract in my pyjamas in the middle of a lockdown pandemic lockdown which was completely unusual circumstances are now very weird i must say but but it just felt it wasn't real because at the time i didn't know if we were even gonna get back racing you know we were in the middle if you guys remember march or april we were full lockdown like we didn't know if normal life was going to come back ,0,Sainz
it was an intense period because it's not easy to negotiate and to sign a contract in by a it was a time where we all discovered the zoom calls you know and we did everything by virtual no and it's the first time i had experience having to have phone calls like that and it was weird very weird but and i still had a full year to do with with mclaren in 2020,0,Sainz
yeah for sure i mean i'm spanish i live very close to italy i feel close to the italian culture because i i grew up in italy a lot doing all of my go-kart races and thanks to that i got to know the history of ferrari and everyone who is a big formula one fan like like i've been all my life knows what ferraris ,0,Sainz
i i had a really good time in mclaren everyone who's been follow following formula one for the last three years know that i managed to achieve the best version of myself in mclaren and know that uh the carlos that they see today is the carlos that i managed to grow up into in mclaren the confidence that mclaren gave me the support it was my first two year deal and there i did a step as a driver and the driver that you see now in ferrari is a lot of it is thanks to to the atmosphere and the people and the way i managed to fill in mclaren and the step that i did there as a racing driver ,0,Sainz
yeah i'm glad someone else talks about it because i didn't know it made a difference because i've i've always been one year in toro so another year in toronto another year in toroso suddenly loaned to renault without knowing if i was going to stay in reno go back to red bull or go back to toro so i don't i didn't know anything and and this uncertainty you don't you never think about it when you are in the in the truck or in the car but then suddenly i found myself in a two-year dealing in mclaren and i said i actually feel a lot more relaxed i can go out there risk an overtake and not having to go to bed that day thinking i had contact with this guy now my career might depend on making sure that the next race i don't do a mistake again ,0,Sainz
when you're in one year deal you know you cannot afford bad momentums you just need to bounce back immediately so the next race you have to make sure you don't do a mistake again but when you are in the in the mindset of i cannot do a mistake again then you are not the same you're not sure as aggressive as you were yeah well not as natural maybe it's not as natural maybe i'm trying to brainstorm it i've gone through this thinking process me myself to to see why but i think it makes a difference well when you're in a two or three year deal you do a mistake you come back next race you try again and the overtake works or the the quality lab works because you're not scared of maybe not finding back that momentum but uh maybe it's me opening up a bit too much but uh is the way it works ,0,Sainz
i was excited already before everything started it's been a an impatient long winter but after seeing the cars i'm even more excited because i think no one expected to see so many formula one cars look so different with such a tight regulations package and then you've seen the mercedes with the tight side pods you've seen our ferrari going completely to the other extreme with these massive side pods you've seen the red bull with the undercut the mclaren with the tight package the aston martin a bit more going in our philosophy and then you realize if this is pure formula one no completely different ideas to probably get to a very similar lap time and and i think it's the beauty of formula one and it's an exciting year that ,0,Sainz
it will but it's also the beauty of formula one that we all pick the best hand-picked the best bits of every car and we try to put it into a same car and ,0,Sainz
of course and there anyone who you talking about we tell we try to not look into lap times we try to focus on ourselves we are all looking into each other and we are all trying to analyze where everyone is we are all looking at gps data we are all looking at sector times at top speeds and you know teams we're trying to play down a bit where everyone is and and that we don't care that we just want to get on with our program but the reality is we are competitive animals and we we just want to know as soon as possible where everyone is just because you're patient you want to know where you are ,0,Sainz
so the first few laps that i did they were not actually that different compared to other years car the speed in the corners feels similar the weight is a bit higher but then once i started really pushing it to the limit in the last few days in barcelona i i realized that the last two or three tenths of the car might come from from a bit of a different driving style and and this is where you need to go back think about where you can find those last two or three times with this car analyze the data and maybe you need to change with your approach your driving style the way you brake the way you turn in and then suddenly the last two tenths of the car are in a different place than last year's car ,0,Sainz
i don't  think three half days of testing is enough to conclude it i've had some indications and some ideas and now in bahrain i'm going to continue with that with those ideas that i had after the test with those analyses that i we did as a team and see if there's potential going that direction and maybe i might get it wrong and i might have to come back to a different direction and try a different one no it's the beauty of experimenting a bit with these cars and with the with your driving and the same applies to to car setup we might go one direction come back try another one come back and see where's the right one ,0,Sainz
i think so and i think there is very good examples in the history of formula one where one car can particularly suit one driver on its driving style i still think the good the greatest formula one drivers are the ones who adapt to anything and are fast in anything but i also find quite interesting how one driver can suddenly extract 100 let's say 102 out of a a car that really suited his style i think again it's the beauty of formula one and i think it's is part of the of the nature of the sport and the human side of the driving ,0,Sainz
yeah i i actually remember having a few conversations with daniel because i did exactly the same step i came from the renault which was uh let's say a particular car in one direction and suddenly the mclaren was a particular car in the opposite direction and i went into my car and telling the mclaren guys guys this the cars are completely different i don't know how to drive this car and i did the test in abu dhabi and i said i need to reset everything and uh and i went into my first year in mclaren having to reset all my references and all my my way of driving and i remember telling dario a couple of times look the cars do feel really really different and and yeah it's it's proved to be the truth that in formula one you can find completely different balances completely different driving styles and you just have to keep adapting and keep absorbing all the information to to be an adaptable driver,0,Sainz
i can tell you what i like if it's my strength or not i think it's others to judge i prefer a car that understeers than a car that oversteers why because my driving is really aggressive when when i'm out on track i know everyone calls me smooth operator but i i was about to say that the biggest misnomer ever he's not actually smooth i can make a car rotate like i turn the car myself with the steering wheel with the pedals i know how to make a car turn ,0,Sainz
let's say so you give me an understeer car don't worry i'll make it turn you give me an oversteer car and all of a sudden i bring that oversteer to the next level and the car on me oversteers like crazy so i need to stabilize the car let's say no and the mclaren was on the steering and i think probably that suited a bit my my my driving style and i managed to to make it turn with the brakes and um ferrari is a bit more neutral a bit more in the middle the renault was really oversteering the renault had a lot of front end and maybe i i struggle a bit to adapt to that but uh it's given me a great variety of of of cars that i've tested in in the last few years to give me a good overall feel of where my driving is and what do i need to work on ,0,Sainz
i know but if you think about it it also makes sense because it means that with my style i turn cars no i let's say i make them turn which is also part of an aggressive rally style also you could see it both ways but uh yeah i love rallying i love uh driving in i drove once or twice in the snow and i loved it it's a completely different game rallying is i honestly think you cannot compare is is so different the formula one style that you cannot really compare,0,Sainz
i think we had a a positive first test in barcelona but again in barcelona no one pushed the engine no one pushed the fuel but our first impression was positive i think we feel like like we've done some good progress since last year i think bahrain is going to start telling us a bit where we are we've seen gps data and we are relatively happy about this gps data that we've seen but again was mercedes and red bull running more or less fuel than us and you only need 10 kilos of fuel to make three or four tons of difference and we know in you come to bahrain qualifying you are three or four tenths in front of behind it's a whole new completely different world no three or four tenths in former one and you just need 10 kilos out of 110 kilos tank fuel tank to make that three or four tenths difference so we don't know we don't know it's it's very difficult to tell,0,Sainz
i thought so before going to barcelona then in barcelona i saw quite let's say big ish differences i i would say similar to last year uh where the field was covered in a couple of seconds i think ,0,Sainz
it does but again suddenly here mercedes has brought this torpedo car with no skype boats and it's got no cooling at all everyone says red bull has brought a big upgrade also we haven't brought massive upgrades we've we are focusing in understanding this car that we brought to barcelona we we think that by optimizing it and by running it in the peak of its downforce and it picks up of its performance there is an upgrade there just by by getting to know the car there's a pretty big upgrade if we manage to optimize it but we haven't brought big things so it makes you doubt whether this massive mercedes step that everyone's talking about the red bull step then all of a sudden ferrari was there in barcelona but this we will not be there anymore after bahrain so or maybe yes but i don't know it's impossible ,0,Sainz
i'm sure he's done his uh analysis and he's uh he's seen gps data probably the same data that i've seen and he's optimistic about ferrari the same way that i i was telling you that we are pretty happy with what we saw but is it enough to beat the the two other giants or no this is difficult no,0,Sainz
yeah but i've been ready for a while for my for my first win and i i was having this conversation i don't just mean first win actually i'm talking are you ready to win the world championship do you feel like you've got a winnership you need a win no and you need consistent volumes and i feel like over the last few years i've shown or i've proved to myself even that every time i had an opportunity to score a podium i i caught it no and and even i had a chance to to win once or twice and i nearly made it north so i'm i'm confident i know you give me the right car i think i can be there ,0,Sainz
it's how it goes sometimes you you need to have the luck on your side and maybe that red flag there in a halfway through a race that i would have been on the lead without that red flag i think no one would have passed me ,0,Sainz
ah yeah because i was genuinely the the second fastest guy behind hamilton that weekend and uh and i was speed to the whole race hamilton and mercedes did this this mistake of beating under under the under the pit lane closed in safety car and uh and i know that lead was mine and  and that the race win was on from there and suddenly the red flag reset everything and and through it made my life a lot more complicated but still made it back to nearly winning ,0,Sainz
you know i am i trust me i am and and if you play tennis or paddle with me then you will see my latino side there now pack out paddle is a thing or whatever yeah yeah i've just started playing paddles good funny yeah i was really surprised by it actually ,0,Sainz
we did uh last night we landed two we did me and lana and against my dad and charles we lost by one point but it was good fun that sounds really fun is the old man still very good he was spanish squash champion and so all the rocket sports he's nearly 60 but he still has this massive talent for rugged sports,0,Sainz
spanish course champion at 16 and his first rally was when he was 18 so he even went to the uk to play squash to live to the uk and play professional squash he's pretty good handy with a rocket right ,0,Sainz
yeah i reckon here i mean paddle is a spanish sport and i've been playing paddle my my whole life so i must be ,0,Sainz
for these cars i have to if you're not in the best condition i reckon the tires are gonna allow us to push a bit more this year the cars are heavier but they still produce a lot of downforce so if i'm not in my best condition then everything's over ,0,Sainz
when i prepare my body my mind gets ready too let's see how i explain this when i am disciplined when i go to the gym every day i do my hour of cardio my hour and a half of weight lifting i wake up early i have my breakfast i have my diet the the mind comes with it all of a sudden you feel strong you feel powerful you feel disciplined you feel ready and and ,0,Sainz
i recommend this to people a lot it's like are you struggling with maybe a bit of mental health lack of self-confidence try waking up one day at seven go to the gym do your workout come back have your coffee and go to work see how you perform at work that day it's completely different you just feel empowered no and when i'm physically ready i'm mentally ready this is and that's i train a lot of the days that i go training i don't train because i need a bigger biceps or a bigger neck or a bigger chest or i train because i know the feeling that the training is going to keep me going into a race or or uh or a day,0,Sainz
I can give you an example my first race in formula one torosa was quite tight on the way then i had to be light as a driver and i was 66 kilo 66 and a half naked 70.5 with full race team kit so let's start let's say 70.5 no with full race team kit nowadays i'm 74 and a half so i've grown four kilos and a half in in these seven years and i can tell you they are not fat it's not bad it's not it's not beer and it's not the fat ,0,Sainz
the neck doesn't weight four kilos more no if not my head would fall off but it's a bit of an egg it's a lot of upper body strength and quite a lot of it is also in the glutes and the legs because i've started working on them quite a lot with dead lifting and squats so you're fit,0,Sainz
i think we we have an honest honestly good relationship away from the truck and we we are actually similar guys in terms of the the things we like to do away from the track and it allows us to have a lot of conversations about life away from the track and we we are genuinely having fun with each other playing paddle playing poker in the airplanes chess we play anything we we actually enjoy it quite a lot and and inside the track we have an honest respect to each other i really respect what charles has done in his career and the way he drives the way he approaches the formula one in general and i think that respect just gives us that mutual respect gives us a good relationship as teammates and um and yeah we we're both keen on keeping that going for the future ,0,Sainz
yeah for sure but uh also was lando and also was marks and also was nico i mean nico hulk about yeah and i ran the phone and danny kivia in his day was amazing there's no one slow in formula one how can i tell you this there's no one like informal one that you would say nah this guy is not up for for formula one they are all crazy quick and in the end is one tenth that makes a difference of making it a good day or a bad day to you no i beat charles by one tenth i'm happy he beats me by one tenth i'm sad where is one tenth in life in enough on one car it's breaking four turn one and he's in a high speed corner that maybe you didn't go as fast as he should have and one day it will go to you one day will go to me but we are all very very quick let's say are you,0,Sainz
no you can't you you we only visualize it because we have the delta laptop that is telling us in the steering wheel that is telling me i went half a ten slower through that corner that lap thanks to that feel that through the steering wheel you you feel it in your body that maybe the car was not at its absolute limit in the middle of the corner and you could have carried a bit more speed you sometimes hit the brakes and you realize ah i maybe i could have break three or four meters later what is three or four meters at 320 kph is three or four meters at 320 kph is that you should have blinked uh a bit later or you should have hit the pedal literally thousandths of a second later no and what is that in real life it's it's not it's it's crazy that the what we are talking about here now and ,0,Sainz
the good yeah but isn't it i i feel is the consistency of being able to do that every weekend that makes you the great because i really believe any formula one driver in their good day is as fast as any other formula one driver in the good day i think we are honestly we are 20 really fast guys right now in formula one and you just need to look into their careers before formula one if you have any doubt so it's a matter of who can do it in a 23 races who can perform at that level more consistently and be always there so ,0,Sainz
satisfying because obviously you always want to be ahead is he's and anyone who says he doesn't it's he's lying no you always want to be ahead but not only in the championship in every statistic and i'm aware he beat me in a lot of other statistics the same way that i beat him in a pretty important one that is the the points no and you want to be ahead and we work our ass off sorry for that to be ahead in every session in every moment of the of the weekend and yeah it was my first year in ferrari ,0,Sainz
but i i managed to get there in a in a good level and and be there straight away since the beginning and especially i managed to peek at the end of the year which was when i was feeling more at home with it with a car and that peak at the end of the year allowed me just to to jump him in the end but he did a very good year too he he was performing at a very high level every race and he made my life extremely difficult ,0,Sainz
i didn't think i needed to beat him to do good things to my reputation because i've already been signed by ferrari i've already done two very good years in mclaren but it's for me it was a reassurance for me and to everyone that i'm that i'm here to to win and to try and be the best and and i keep keep trying to prove that i i i try to do the same with lando with max with with anyone i the fact that it was charles is is uh anecdotal no but this is what we are all trying to do here just try to prove that you're the best one and you're trying to be the best one ,0,Sainz
i want to think so that's why i know where charles is in in uh in formula one and i think how good i know how good he is i have pretty good comparisons to do to make with with lando with max and i know where where he stands and yeah i know it was a good year for me 2021 for for that reason,0,Sainz
i feel like it's a great opportunity to have had a one full year with the whole team so i know how the team works i know everyone on the team i know how to operate i know how to who do i need to chase to to get one thing or the other we've improved massively the race team since race one of last year with strategy with the way we we work together but at the same time on the driving side this has start from zero with the new cars so all the things that i discovered last year with the ferrari the way to drive it where was the tricks of those last two tents that in the end of the year i knew exactly where those two tents were i knew which setup i liked from that ferrari 2021 then all of a sudden i don't have that anymore and i need to go and chase it again and i need to go and find those last two tents of setup those last two tenths of driving and that's where it gets more complicated if it would have been a continuation from last year the car would have been a an evolution of last year's car then i think it would have been a lot easier ,0,Sainz
it could it could help me and it could be an advantage but at the same time honestly though i think in formula one i think everyone is good on that i think i don't think i i think i've i've done well on adapting to new teams don't get me wrong and i think it's been a strong point of mine but when i look at charles when i look at london when i look at max i don't think they will struggle to adapt to a new car i think we are all so talented that ,0,Sainz
different different different and and ferrari has its it's very strong points and and things that we we need to work on but i think it's what changes the most is the culture and the way you interact with with people and the the culture of the team but i also might say that all the teams in formula one are still also converging quite a lot in this sense and we are all becoming perfectly run machines of people you know and we all run like a spaceship you know when when you go to a meeting in all the teams everyone starts to speak a bit the same language and the same in the same way and formula one is reaching a level that if you are not at that level then you are not formula one and i think it's super interesting to to see this across all the teams ,0,Sainz
i understand better the bigger picture of what it means to be a ferrari driver and what it's like to have already fossil behind you in every country you go to and this is this they've tried to explain to me before a thousand times and i tried to understand but i never really understood and now that i've experienced driving at monsa for ferrari ,0,Sainz
it is different because the the fosse are so passionate and so crazy about formula one and the team that is something i've never lived before i've seen people being crazy about me in spain but you can see that they are crazy about something bigger than you it's is you are in charge of making this whole brand this whole country proud not not yourself or not as the fans you're in charge of bringing the cavalino to the top it's it's like playing for our national team is you're representing italy when you are driving for ferrari so it's something bigger than than yourself you know it's something bigger than i'm trying to explain it the best i ,0,Sainz
yeah and i go to bologna airport nearly every week and people recognize me nowadays i i wear a cup and a mask and and i started to know the tricks to don't get recognized too much but uh yes you still do the problem is when they recognize you they get so nervous nervous but you cannot imagine there's people shaking with their hand they shake they don't know how to put turn the camera around and they take a picture of something in front of you instead of something instead of yourself and and they get really nervous they shake and it's crazy crazy man that is crazy isn't it ,0,Sainz
it surprised me the the good atmosphere that you live in i mean i'm living in a in a team that feels again like a family everyone talked to me about the pressure of being in ferrari and all that look in the end we're all human beings and we're all enjoying being part of formula one yes there's a huge responsibility driving for this team but we are still a group of engineers drivers mechanics that we are still getting on well we between each other and we form this team and i thought that this in ferrari maybe was not possible because of the pressure and the responsibility but it's if anything is the opposite and you feel you feel it in the same way ,0,Sainz
yeah there's a particular department that maybe if they listen to this they like the logistics guys that they take care of our traveling our clothes that goes everywhere it's incredible the way that they take care of us is we are so it's different everything perfectly folded everywhere we go the the suit the boots perfectly is everything is perfect this and you they take care of you amazing ,0,Sainz
yeah uh yeah everywhere we travel to we we have a ferrari except maybe a couple of races we have alphas or or maserati but uh i would say eighty percent of the races we get a ferrari,0,Sainz
i have a alfa romeo quadrifoglio it's five hundred and nine horsepower is the big one yeah it's beautiful it's a suv which i go a lot to the countryside and it does me well i'm buying a new ferrari now it's my first car that i buy ,0,Sainz
you might get a bit of a deal but not a lot there is not as much as people think let's say well ,0,Sainz
it's difficult to tell right now but i'd like to get a win and then the rest let's see but you know i keep chasing the the my dream in that in formula one that is to win first race obviously then a championship but doing a championship you need to win a race so i will keep chasing that i'm not saying it will happen but it's what i wake up every morning or what i go to sleep with in my my head every day so i wish it can happen ,0,Sainz
